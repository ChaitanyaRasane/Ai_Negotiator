Seller: That is far below my asking price, I could not in good faith accept $50, I am sorry. I could perhaps go a bit lower, but $50 just will not cut it. A bike like this is worth spending on a tub or two of white wall cleaner.

Seller: $200, You come pick it up, Then Ill throw in my tub of cleaner.

Seller: Yes that's correct. We're asking for around $3500. The neighborhood is great. The house has a brick patio in the backyard, and the yard has a gardener, its very relaxing.
Buyer: is it non smoking?
Seller: Nope, you can smoke all you want. Id rather it be out on the patio, but on a rainy day I understand.
Buyer: That is actually an issue for me, my son is ashmatic and i am sensitive to the smells . Can you come down to 2400 to make this place worth while for us?
Seller: I'm sorry but that's not a problem, as nobody smokes in the house currently or in the past, so as long as you don't smoke it won't be a problem for your son. I was just letting you know that you are allowed to smoke if you please. The price I can drop down to is going to have to be 2900 at the bare minimum. I hope you understand, I have other clients coming in looking at the place and some have already tried to buy it for around $2600.",4,housing,

Seller: It is taking up space so I am selling it today. I have an offer for $160 and he can pick it up within the hour

Seller: You are killing me as I really do not want to sell it to this other guy as I know him personally and he abuses his bikes, but that is way under what I paid for it. The Shimano gears alone cost me an extra $50 to add. I paid over $500 for this bike. How about this, since you see like you are a great person, just starting out financially and I remember being there. Price is $150 and you give me $100 now and $50 in two weeks, We sign and agreement and you pick it up today  
Buyer: I lost my job, so I can't guarentee anything next week, I think I can get another $5 from my mom, so I can give you $120 total.

Buyer: Okay. I was looking at a townhome a few blocks away. They offer free heat and have a big bath with jacuzzi jets. What kind of tub or shower does your place have?
Seller: It has a very nice garden tub and shower upstairs and then a half bath downstairs.  Both are newly updated and have new tiles and flooring
Buyer: I noticed that you are located by a drug-testing facility for recently that is frequented by people on probation and parolees. I am very concerned about that.
Seller: Yes I understand that, but we do have a security system in place in the unit that you can activate for a small monthly fee.  I'm asking $1800 for the apartment but I can do $1700 to adjust for the heating cost if that would suit you
Buyer: I am willing to offer you $1500. I think that is a fair price for the location
Seller: Okay, I will accept that offer.

Buyer: Hello, are the cushions used at all?
Seller: No, these are new. We just had more than needed. If your sofa fits the 3-seater 80"" design of these specific cushions, it's a whole lot cheaper than buying all new furniture!
Buyer: I see, do you think you can come down on the price, One box usually goes for $12 so I was trying to find a deal 
Seller: Well they are brand new in the box still. You just don't have to stand in line, order on TV, or pay taxes to get them. What price did you have in mind?

Buyer: Yes, I checked the comps in the area and it's about the going price for the size of the house.
Seller: I really can not go that low, I would be willing to include water service and change the air filters every month for $2,000 per month.

Seller: We normally charge one month's rent to move in, but since you want a lower price, I can offer you free access to the workout room for rent of $2200.  Does that work for you? 
Buyer: No, I appreciate the offer, but I don't think $2200 is acceptable.  I like the laundry convenience, so how about $1725? 
Seller: Okay, I can do $1800 if you are willing to sign a 3-year rental agreement.  Does that work for you?

"Seller: Hi there!  Are you interested in the apartment?
Buyer: I've been looking at it. Why did the last tennant leave?
Seller: The last tenant left because they bought a home of their own.  We are actually running a special today.  You can secure the apartment for the discounted price of $1800 if you sign the lease today.  Are you interested?
Buyer: I am interested, but that price is too much for my family. We have budgeted for $1000 monthy rent. We can pay our deposit today if that monthly price will work for you.
Seller: We cannot afford to rent for $1000.  What is the absolute highest rent you can afford?  If you cannot afford more, then we cannot rent to you.  
Buyer: We really like the home, and would hate to lose out on this offer. If you can include water and electric I can pay a total of $1500. The extra $500 will more than cover what we use, and would allow us to rework our budget to afford the higher rent.
Seller: I wish I could agree to that.  How about if I waive your security deposit and have you sign a 3-year lease.  This way you go into the rental with a bit of extra cash to allow you to reorganize your budget.  I can lower the rent to $1750 if you are willing to do this.  Water is included, but not electric at this price.  Deal?
Buyer: That is much appreciated. We can almost fit that into our budget. If you can take an extra $50 off, bringing the total to $1700 per month, we have a deal.

Seller: Unfortunately, $2000 is too low for a high demand apartment like this one.  I can bring the price down to $2500.  Can you do this price?
Buyer: $2500 would be reasonable if I didn't have to pay to move all my stuff. Would you be able to offer a free moving service if I paid the premium $2500 price?

Seller: Well, there are some problems. It's missing a drawer divider and it's scratched. For some reason I can't really fathom, I decided to color in the scratches with a brown marker, even though I'm a master finish carpenter. I guess I was just incredibly lazy when I was getting ready to sell this furniture.
Buyer: Then with all that said would you take $50 for it?
Seller: 50 seems way too low, lets have a little more negotiation here. Let me tell you, this is a very sturdy piece of furniture, it can easily take the weight of two adults slamming into it for at least 20 minutes. That's how it got the scratches.
Buyer: Oh wow okay. Well with all your telling me this doesn't seem worth much more than 50 to me. 
Seller: Friend, this is the perfect side table for so many things, the drawers are big enough to hold all sorts of adult toys. It would be a steal at $80.
Buyer: Hmm how about 70 if i come get it today?
Seller: Okay, you come to pick it up, you can have it for $75, and I'll even throw in whatever's left in the drawers when you get here. Don't worry, it's all been sterilized.

Seller: Accessories are included. Could you do $35? It's listed for $39 currently. 
Buyer: I didn't want to pay too much for a new phone, so I was hoping $30 would be good for you. Would an extra $2 be alright with you?

Buyer: Okay and it has also been repainted right? 
Seller: Yes, I got it professionally done
Buyer: That's good but with the original paint it would be worth more. Would you sell it for 140? 
Seller: That's pretty low.  Even sanded down, this bike is worth 190.  Lowest I can go is 200 with what I put into it already (mods and painting)
Buyer: Modifying it actually decreases the value too, customizing something makes it worth less you don't just add on the cost of custom parts. That takes away any value it had as a vintage item. 
Seller: Hmm, well it sounds like you probably aren't interested then.  As a non-vintage bike, it's worth 200.  The vintage should add on to it.  Lowest I'll go is 180 if you pick it up.",0,bike,

Buyer: Will you sell this for $150?
Seller: No, I am willing to negotiate but that is too low. Do you have any questions about the bike? It is really in good condition.
Buyer: I think the price is a little high, I can buy a 21-speed new for $350, and that includes a warranty. What about $165?
Seller: You haven't even asked any questions about the bike. If you had you would know that it has CST 700X38C hybrid tires, Schraeder valves, Rear Shimano Altus derailleur with MegaPulleys... and many other great feaures. So, as you can see this bike has many great upgrades making it fully worth the asking price of $200..
Buyer: I'm familiar with this model of bike, my brother had one just like it. You didn't mention those upgrades in your listing though, that does add a little value to it. I'm still not sure that it's worth quite $200 though considering what I can buy new for a similar price. I'd be willing to raise my offer to $150.
Seller: That is why I kept asking if you had any questions. I'm a bit concerned you're just a reseller looking to undercut other buyers and then make a profit. If you want a new bike without all these great upgrades you should definitely get one. But all things considered I think I'd better not accept such low offers right now. I can go $195. ",0,bike,
