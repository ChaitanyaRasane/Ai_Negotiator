Hey there!,Hello. Are you interested in my two beautiful tables? :)
Yes I definitely am! I'd love a set like these for my living room! I have $720 cash that I could bring to your house in 30 minutes to pick up the tables. Would that price and timing work for you?,"$720 cash and in a half hour? I can definitely agree to that. You will give them a good home, right? I do love these tables."
"Hi! I would love to own your Toyota.  Could we talk about the price, though?",Sure Is there something wrong with my offer?
I'm a college student on a budget and it woud be awesome to finally get a dependable automobile.  Why are you selling?,It's a second vehicle that I really didn't need anymore.
"2 cars? Wow!  Well, I am on a strict budget, but I could give you $8000 cash for it.",Hmm that's a bit more of a cut then I was thinking. How about the 8000 and a promissory for another 1000 over the next six months?
You would do that for me?!  THat's amazing!  SUre!,okay then
"I'm very intterested in your apartment, could you tell me a little more about it?","Yes, it is completely remodeled, 2 br, 1 bath, has a garage and other off street parking.  It is close to a grocery store and it is near the Bart."
Sounds good. Would you be able to reduce the price? I have seen similar apartments in this area for significantly cheaper. I was thinking about $1400,"I can't do !400 BUT I can do 1700 and it would include internet, water, and trash service."
"Oh wow, that sounds like quite the deal. I like not having to worry about the extra bills each month. Can I come look at the apartment today?",You can and you could move in anytime as it is available.
"Hello, I like your windmill and might be interested in buying it... can you tell me a bit about it...",It's a whimsical wall structure!  Perfect for interior decoration!  And it's a pinwheel.
How long have you owned it?,"Thirty or fifty years, It's a family heirloom of indeterminable age"
Have you cleaned it with brass cleaner at all,Of course!  It's in super special awesome condition!
But ...does it ''do'' anything? Does the pinwheel spin? It doesn't look like it spins...,Of course it spins!  It's a fantastical pinwheel!  It's BIG
But it doesn't generate electricity right?... it just spins for show right?,Of course!  It's a super spinner!  Made by Curtis!
"Well, I'm not sure I believe all that... but it is nice to look at ... I could offer you 300 for it, and I could pick it up today...","That would be acceptable, at $350"
Is there any chance I could pay you 342 instead... It's a superstition thing... 350 is bad luck...,"That is fine.  Unfortunately, I dislike the number $342.  Instead, $347"
"Ok, sounds groovy",Dynamite!
Hey I am interested in renting this place if it is still available?,It sure is as of now anyways
I have 10 classmates and myself and this place would be perfect as it is close to campus.,It sounds like you need all the room you can get. Do you have any questions about it?
Does it include any ammenities?,"Oh absolutely! It is Cable/DSL Ready , 2 blocks from campus and  1.5 blocks from Telegraph avenue, it has 2 full bathrooms, washer/Dryer unit, On-Site office management team and it is a clean well-run apartment building. It has a brand new kitchen as well."
Would you take 9100.00 a month or maybe cover the trash and water.  We are poor graduate students.,"$9300 is about the lowest I can go, it's got a brand new kitchen and the location is one that many want."
Okay we will take it.,Awesome! Thank you for everything
"Hi, I'm interested in your apartment. It sounds like it's really close to the bus line, isn't it?","Yes, I think you'll find it's easily within walking distance."
Sounds like a plan! Do you have any questions about the table?,You're the buyer. I'm the seller. you have questions for me
Yes my apologies! Is the table used?,Yes. It's used. But in a very nice condition still. sturdy and structurally sound. I say 100 is a good price
I would never pay the list price for a used table. How about $50?,it's an oak table. oak is an expensive wood because it's so dense and heavy. makes for great furniture wood. I'll go as low as 80 but that's about it.
"I will pay $70, under the condition that I will come and pick up the table! Is that ok with you? You wont have to pay for shipping or the cost of gas.","75, you come and pick it up. then that's a deal"
Ok sounds like a plan! Will you polish it nicely for me?,"no, I won't polish it. it's sold as is"
"Hi, I'm interested in buying the matte black iPhone 6 but I have some questions.",Excellent.  Go ahead.
"First, are there any scratches, dings, or other imperfections?","The phone is practically like new.  No scratches or dings, etc."
"Great. Do you know the retail price by chance? How long have you had it? What makes it ""custom?""",I do not know the retail price offhand.
That's okay. I can look it up.,I think I have had it like six months maybe.
"Ah, not long. Why are you getting rid of it?",IPhone 7 is out.  I want that one before the new one comes out!
Haha I understand! It's for my husband. He broke his phone and doesn't want to spend a ton on a new one. Would you accept $125? I found a gold one for $120 earlier but it was too far.,Ouch!  No.  I'm sorry.  I can only go as low as $300.00.  It has 64 Gigabytes!
That might be a bit out of our price range. Does it come with a charger?,"Yes, it comes with a charger, and as indicated, it has a custom paint job!  It is totally worth it."
I would like to know more about this offer.,yes great plan
Would you accept $35 cash,let me check with boss he said the low he can go is 40
hi! I am very interested in your bike! are there any issues with it?,Hello! There are no issues with the bike. It works really well. I'm just leaving the area.
awesome! It would be perfect for me! I was wondering if you would take a little lower for it? closer to 120?,I would really prefer to stay close to the price I listed. Does $145 sound okay? The bike is very sturdy and well made.
"If you can give it to me for 140 and include a helmet I can come pick it up tonight,cash in hand.","Ok, that sounds reasonable. I'll see you tonight at 8pm!"
"I see your add for the shelf, I'm getting it for my daughter for her birthday, I am really short on cash, could you take $25?","I am sorry that is low , I ma lookign to get 40"
"I am really spreadding myself thin, but I can do $28.50","I think you failed to read my add, I asked that everyoen supply there phone number in replies."
"I'm sorry, you can call me at 555-555-1234",Thank for the number. I suppose we can continue to discuss the price on this platform.
"My daughter really wants this, but I have been out of work for several months and can't afford much. Would you Take $30? That is all I have on me, and I can pick it up today.",I am sorry to hear of that hard situation. Yes I will take $30.
Hi! I think this is a really neat bike and am very interested in it!,It is in great condition. It is too big for me. I am asking $250 for the bike and accesories.
"Well, given the fact that it only retails for 200, that seems a little high. I am willing to pay 160 since the accessories do not actually work, and it has been used before.",I would be willing to sell it for $185.
What about 180 and I will come pick it up today?,Perfect. I will see you later today to pick up the bike.
"Hello, yes I have a few questions. What is the mileage on this car and how long have you owned it?","I am the first owner of this car, bought it right off the lot. It has only 80k miles and the new michilin tires have seen only 3k miles.I am asking only $4500 for her."
That all sounds pretty good. If I came by tonight would I be able to take it for a test drive? And you would consider taking $4 for it if I paid cash?,"The test drive is okay, the engine purrs like a kitten. I was looking for serious offers only. BUT, I am willing to let her go for $4250."
Do you have a cover for it?,I sure do and that comes with the vehicle. Not a scratch of ding on it.
Alright I think I can do $4250 if everything checks out,Come on by for that test drive. I'll e-mail you my address.
Yes very interested?  how tall are they?,They are 24 inches
are you able to deliver?,Yes. For the full price of $65 I can deliver.
would you accept 45 if I pick them up?,$55?
"nice bike dude, what are you asking?",$40. Built it myself. Has good rims too.
nice. i like the color. I only have 30 =though,I would take $35
32?,Sure
Hi! I am interested in purchasing this vanity piece!,"Hi, I am glad to hear that, any questions?"
Yes in fact! Is the glass inside the piece interchangable? I have a great piece of glass that I would like to replace that with!,"I think it may be possible, but I am not sure 100%. If you have the knowledge I would say yes."
Awesome! I am willing to offer $40 for the piece. How does that sound?,"That sounds very low for such high quality. i am wanting to make a deal, but I need at least 60."
"Ok, since the glass is not of my style I am willing to pay $50 and I will also come and pick it up. Ok?",I suppose I can agree to that.
Hello. Does this item require batteries and are they included?,It comes with a wall charger
Is this a used item?,Yes but it is very good condition. I've lowered the price to $50 and I'll even deliver it to you and help you set it up if you'd like.
"Hey there, this place looks amazing, anything you could tell me about it price, size, and location wise?","I'm listing this wonderful apartment for $2250. It's a 1 bedroom apartment, you can lease short-term if that's something you'd prefer. It provides great views and it's located in a great location."
"Okay, that sounds amazing. But the price is a tad bit high for me. Is there any way you guys could do $1800?",Unfortunately there is too much demand for this wonderful apartment for me to drop the price that low. Would you consider $2000?
Hello,Hi. Do you have any questions about the listing?
Does the listing include a washer and dryer?,"Yes, we do have washer and dryer hook ups. Any other questions?"
Is the listing carpeted?,"Yes, most rooms are carpeted but there are some rooms such as the living room that have hardwood floors."
"Do the garage doors include an opener, or are they manual?",The garage doors are automatic. Are you still interested?
Would you be willing to throw in a free washer and dryer?,"Yes, of course. Would you buy for $2200?"
Hello. Has this case been used before?,"No, it's new. 25 bucks is a steal"

"Hey there! I really need some samsung 3d glasses, and I saw yours! Are they good quality and will they work 100% with my plasma TV>",Yes We used them with our plasma TV before our tv broke. They are in good condition I am asking $40 for 4 glasses.
Cool! Could I get them for $30 if I come by with cash in a few hours and pick them up? that would work very well with me.,Could you do $35 we only used them about 5 times and they should still have battery life to them.
"Hi, I am interested in your 1 bath studio. What condition is this in?",Its in  a great condition. Everything is very well kept and organized.
I have a child. Do you know if this is located near any schools or parks?,Yes absolutely. There are many schools and parks around. There is actually a very famous park right nearby. Its a five minute drive. I am sure you will enjoy that!

Hi  there how are you?,I am great how are you tonight?
Very well  thanks! What condition is the trunk in?,The carrier is in perfect shape I think I only used it about 2 or 3 times
Ok that sounds great! However i only have like 7 bucks would you accept that if i threw in a 6 pack of coors?,"Yuck can't stand the stuff it's bud light or nothin for me.  What I could do is knock it down to $12 if you can come get it right away,"
I am good. How are you? I see your interested in my table?,I am good..  Thank you!
Would you like to buy my table?,Could u tell me more about it?  Any scratches or warping anywhere?

Deal i will also come to you.,That sounds awesome.  Thx.
Hi do you still have the bookcases?,Yes it's very nice
Are they handmade?  They look like they are.,"No they aren't handmade, but have that cool look :)"
Ok well I do only need 1 would you be willing to take $20?,I need to relocate to Montana and can't take them but I'll take 40 for both
well you did say you would sell them seperate and I don't really have the room for both but if you can do $30 for both I can find somewhere to put the other one.,Yes 30 is great
"Hi, I am interested in your bike","Terrific! It is in in pretty darn good condition, no dings or dents or damage. The paint has had a few small scratches that have been touched up."
How old is it?,"About 30 years old, it is an Italian Masi, not a California one, so it is pretty special."
"I have $945 in cash in my wallet. If I come and pick it up myself, will that be enough?","You know what? I wasn't going to go that low, but what the heck. It's yours!"
hi your home is really beautiful,Are you interested in the cottage?
"yes i am, but the price is out of my current budget, are you willing to lower it to 2450","I really can't go down that low $3,500 is a fair price can you make a serious offer?"
"i was being serious, i mean it doesn't come with electric so i think my offer is pretty reasonable",Actually the guest cottage is the one that doesn't have any electricity if you look at the listing.
"ok 2800 can you work with that?, if i bring my own furniture","That's still too low. How about $3,200"
3000 then we have a deal,3100 and we have a deal
"Hey there, I noticed your post about the table. I was looking to make an offer on it, if it is still available.",It is still available. Do you have any questions about it?
"I am short of money, but I would really like to get this table for my daughter's room. Could I offer you 300 for the table?",Yes of course that works for me.
"Hey, nice phone you have there, how new is it?","It is brand new, still in the box. It's also unlocked for all carriers."
"Oh wow, and it's the new seven too, no wonder it's fetching for a pretty penny. You still have all the colors?","This one is Jet Black but we have Gold, matte and gold. For just $780"
"Well, but there has to be one of those colors that sells less often? My budget's closer to 700 unfortunately :(","I can do $700, you have a deal."
Hi! I am very interested in this aparnment. Is it still available?,It is! It's a great place. Small and quiet and very spacious
"What are the schools like? Are there any kid friendly areas, such as parks, in the area?",The schools are great. The elementary school is 3 blocks away. A few playgrounds and there is common area outside the unit.
Great! Do you accept pets?,We accept cats and small dogs
Awesome! What is the going monthly rate?,The rent is 1900 a month. It's a steal for the area especially you get your own parking
"That is a bit out of our range, considering we would have to purchase new furniture.",It's well worth the money
Does it come furnished at all?,It doesn't come with any furniture but we have picnic benches outside.
What is the security deposit?,there is a 1 month security deposit
Would you be willing to accept half a month security deposit the first month and half the second month?,Sure
I am.  Can you tell me how old/new it is?,"It's only about 6 months, my band was beginning to do gigs but we had a falling out. Now I need to sell it because I'm going back to work. What's your budget?"
$45 seems a little high considering it is used.  How low do you think you can go?  I was thinking about $25,"I can't do that, it's barely used and it needs a good owner like you to crank it up to 11. I've only used it at about 7. I can do 35 lowest."
I'm interested in the home you advertised.,"Great, it's an amazing home. I am renting the upstairs bedrooms for $2800. It is in a nice neighborhood and I'm gone half of every month so you'll basically have the place to yourself half the time."
It sounds perfect.  Would you be willing to take $2500 a month?,If you pass a credit check and have a security deposit then I can accept that offer.
"hi, I am very interested in this coat rack!",Hello. Yes it is quite a conversation piece.
Hi. I'm wondering if you would be willing to accept a price of around $2000 instead. I'd be willing to pick it up from wherever you have it now.,"I cannot go down that low. I'd be willing to knock it down to 3000, and throw in a bikelock with a custom helmet"
"Hi, I was wondering if you could take $80. I am buying for a nursing home and can't afford much.","I apologize, but I can't accept $80, as I was really looking to get $100 for it. Would $93 work for you?"
"If we could make it an even $90, we would have a deal.",Give me $91 and I'll deliver it to you. Deal?
Hello! I'm very interested in your radio. How would you describe its condition?,It is very gently used - like new still.
"Awesome! Do you know if it plays FLAC files, in addition to mp3?","I honestly don't know if it plays that file format. It does play .mp3 as well as WMA files. It also is compatible with smartphones and usb/sd cards, so it is very flexible."
"I think I can work with that. My paycheck is late this week, so do you think you'd be able to take $13 for the radio?","With all of it's features, I honestly believe it would be a good buy at $50 - so I have listed it at quite a good bargain already. I am kind of firm at $15."
Would you be able to throw in any freebies or delivery?,I am guessing my price includes delivery! How can anyone beat this deal?
I did. It sounds great. Perfect for me. I do have a service animal.,That will be no problem. We don't always allow pets but service animals are acceptable as long as they remain orderly
I did. It sounds great. Perfect for me. I do have a service animal.,I'm hoping to receive 1595 but am willing to talk within reason
Sounds good. I can work with that. I would like to pay $1400 a month. Is there any way you would accept that?,How about $1450 and we have a deal?
I could go to $1430,That sounds like a good compromise
that's a nice chaise you got there. the recliner come up to the normal position?,"Hey there! Yes, the recliner comes back up so you can sit up right like a standard recliner. All of the parts still work on it, we just need to sell it to make more room!"
"yeah totally understandable. tell you what. i can do, 200 for this. cash. i pick it up. you won't have to lift a finger.","I'm sorry, but 200 is just a little bit too low from what we paid for it. We'd be willing to get it loaded for you if you could meet at 280"
"ok. still a bit high... i can do, say 250, but really that's the limit for me","If you can meet at 270, you have a deal and we'll still load it up for you!"
"I might be interested, but the price seems too high.",How much are you looking to spend?
Only about $350 or so,"Ouch...this bike has been well maintained by a pro mechanic for years, it still runs like it's new. This isn't a $350 bike"
Sorry I don't mean to insult you. It does look like a nice bike. What's the lowest that you are willing to go on it?,$600 and I'll deliver it to the location of your choice
I wish I could say yes but I just can't. It's still a little too high for me. Could you meet me in the middle at $475?,$550 and you've got a deal
I can't do that. I'm going to have to modify it for it to be able to work for me.,"Why's that? And $500, final offer"
I am! Can you tell me the mileage and whether it's been wrecked?,"it has been wrecked but only 40,000 miles on it"
"Thanks. Given the wrecked condition and the higher mileage for a 2015 I think the blue book value is closer to $9,000. Is your price negotiable?","not for 9,000 I can go down to 12k but no lower"
"Would you consider $11,000 if I pay cash today?","11,500 today only that's my lowest"
Hi I am interested in this item. Please elaborate more on it?,3 bedrooms with extra space!
The listing is not about bedroom. It tells me its a vintage rattan trunk?,Mine says I am a potential buyer of a home! lol
Woah! That's crazy I guess we quit it then,"Will we still get our code, or get redirected?! lol"
Hello I'm interested in this property. Yes have a couple of questions.,What can I help you with?
Are the utlities included here?,"The utilities are included, and wifi as well. This one does not include parking though, it is available for more."
How much is the parking per month?,The parking is an extra $40 a month.
"Okay, and are pets not allowed at all? Or is there a fee for having a pet?",I am sorry but pets are not allowed.
Okay. Now this is a bit out of my price range budget wise. I'm a professional artist so anything I can save is choice. Is it at all possible to rent this unit for 800. Comparable apartments in the area are running at around 850.,"I am sorry but I could not go lower than $1250 on this high end propert.  It is also close to the downtown area, with amenities."
"All I can do is 1000 a month other than that it won't be possible for me, especially with the parking fee as well.","That is too low , $1250 is my final offer."
"I am. My husband an I have been trying to get a tandem for awhile now. We sold our last one when we had kids, now that they are older, we can get back into it. How is the condition? Are you the original owner? Is it road ready?","Yeah, this is a spare we kept in a storage unit, and we haven't been on the road in a while. It's definitely road ready."
We know our tandem bikes and comps in the area put this one around $135. Would you take that if I picked it up?,"Oh wow you two have shopped around? Really want it then, 135 is fair. Let's do it."
"I am interested in the bike but 600 is too much as compared to the other models out there, like Zurich","yes this is a custom model, higher end"
I know the steel frame is custom but it isn't high end enough to justify that price.  What features does it come with?,"this isn't a street bike, it's for racing. Are you buying it for yourself? how tall are you?"
"I am 72 inches.  I understand what kind of bike it is, that kind of riding is popular where I am from.",right and I know it's used so i can come down to 500
That is still too much for me.  If it doesn't have any other high quality features other than the custom frame $300 is more what I am looking at.,I'll meet you in the middle at 400 only because I know I'm not going to racing anymore
Hi I am interested in the furniture,"Hello, thank you for your interest, I will give you some information on it. You are looking at a couch, loveseat, chair and ottoman. It's a great set and very comfortable."
"Yes, I can see that it is pretty worn in from the pictures, would you be willing to accept 300 for them?","it is in great shape, however, I must also mention it does have some staining and because of this I am willing to go lower on the offer so I will accept $300 for it"
Good morning I an wondering about the receiver.,What would you like to know?
are the speakers in good condition. No buzzing or crackling.,These speakers sound great! Clear and crisp quality.
Are all the connectors and wire included?,"Yes, all cables are included - along with a remote, for ease of use from your favorite chair!"
Sounds  nice. Would you come down on the price a bit. I was thinking more like 25$.,It's a great sound system. I was really hoping to get around $50 for the whole set.
I couldn't really go above 35 for it.,Do you live here in town?
"Yes , I am nearby.","I could do $40 and deliver it for you, since you're nearby."
"That seems fair, if you will help me set it up too.",Sure! That'll be no problem
"Hi there, Im interested in the Schwinn you posted","Hello! Yes it is a 15"" mountain bike with 21 speeds and grip shift. It is light enough to lift easily."
Hello I am interested in your listing. Can you tell me a bit about it please?,"sure, all 4 cubes for sale. Lightly used, each comes with a desk and chair. Also, I'll throw in a file cabinet"
Does the filing cabinet have the key?,Absolutely! $500 and they are yours
"Well the listing price says $400, and I don't really need the filing cabinet if it is going to jump the price up. I was hoping to come down on the price actually.",Whats your offer?
I was thinking about $300 .,$300 and you have to pick them up.
Hi is the bike still for sale?,"Hi, yes it is. It is in good condition, has new shifters rims and brakes. It is missing the rear brake cable though, and has a little bit of surface rust but nothing major."
How old is the bike?,I've had it for about 5 years now.
"Since there is some rust and it is a little older, would you mind going down on the price? $198? I would even be willing to go pick it up myself.",Sure that sounds like a fair price.
Good morning!  I'm interested in your futon chair.  Is it still available?,Yes! Do you have any questions about my chair?
"Any issues?  Tears, stains?","Nope, none at all. It's in excellent condition. I am a bit lazy and used it to mostly just hang clean, dry laundry."
Haha...I do the same thing with my treadmill.  I see you're asking $100.  Would you accept $90 if I came and picked it up?,Absolutely! I'm just thankful to get rid of it and free up space!
Hi there,Interested in this property?
"Yeah, but it looks like it might need some work that I would have to pay for, so I was hoping I could get it for $850",I can't do that. It's been updated recently and has stainless steel appliances. It's a beautiful studio in a great neighborhood. 1895 is a steal
"I can't do that. I could go up to $900, if it helps you out?",That's crazy. A studio half the size went for 1800. How about 1650? Recently remodeled!
It's not the size that I'm basing this on... it's the location and exterior. How about $1000?,Did I mention it comes with an offshores bank account with 500k? $1750. ;)
"Wow, that sound shady. How about this... $1050 and I don't report you to the feds? ;)",LOL. 1400 and you have a deal.
Make it 1300 and I'll shake your hand right now,"Alright, deal"
"Awesome, thanks!",Pleasure doing business with you!
hi I am interested in your soundstation. can you tell me more about it?,"Well, it's in very good condition, it was used in my office for only a short period of time.  It's practically brand new."
does it work with any phone?,"It should work with any standard telephone, yes"
ok would you take $46 for it? I will pick it up myself.,"Yes, that sounds reasonable.  Please bring cash, and let's just meet in downtown Berkeley, okay?"
So you'd be willing to take $20?,yes
"You list price is $39, where do you get $50",well tips how about 38.00
"Hey, this place sounds nice, but a little bit out of my price range. Why should I pay so much for it?",East Davis is a very popular right now and this price is pretty consistent with other similar units in the area. There are two bedrooms and two baths so there is plenty of space for two roommates!
What's in the area?,"Plenty of cafes, restaurants, and shopping all within 5 blocks! It's a very hot area right now."
How does $1200 a month sound?,"I wouldn't be able to take $1200. Like I mentioned, similar units in the area are going for more."
I can't go any higher than $1600 without having to find a very fortunate roomate.,I'll take $1600.
Yeah i'm interested....would you be willing to go to a lower price?,As long as it's reasonable. :)
Would you be willing to accept $75?,I'd probably be persuaded to go with 100.
That's a bit out of my price range...how about $85?,"At the 120 range, I was losing money. How close to 100 are you willing to go?"
"Alright...I can go to $90, would that work?","Split the difference,  you got a deal at 95. That's 25 off. . ."

Hello. I am very interested in the chairs. I can pay cash and pick them up for $150.00,"I can't sell them for half the asking price, sorry.  The price is firm"
"300.00 seems a bit much, especially if I am picking them up and have cash on hand....",Delivery would be $50 extra.  Paying cash does not offer a discount
"yes, but I am not asking for delivery. Cash will save you money in credit card transaction fees. Let's do 200 and I can come pick them up right now",Transactions fees would be less than $5.  I will not go lower than $275.  That is lower than the normal price they sell for every day.  $275 is my final offer.
"unless you have stellar credit card processor, your fees will be closer to 15.00 for 275. 250, cash on hand, I pick up, and will come get them right now.","$275 is the lowest price.  I cannot get them discounted from my supplier.  Any less, and it is not worth the sale."
"We are talking 25.00 here. I like the chairs, but I am not going over 250.00.",I guess we cannot make a deal then.  You will have to reject my offer.
"Wow, these look great I think I would like to offer $114.00",Too low.
I will pick them up then for 140.00,"How about this. You buy all 6, I'll knock off 5 bucks a piece on each chair."
okay so what will be my total price,870 for the set. I have other buyers so its a take it or leave it deal.
ok thanks,Great. You come to pick them up.
"I would only like one, but would you take $125?","Yes, that is a fair price. It's a deal!"

So can you deliver it?,Sure. That won't be a problem. Will you be willing to pay the listed price for it?
"Absolutely not, I'm thinking more $40. It needs another $100 in work.","That's a fair point, but $40 is too low for me. I'll go up to $65 for it, and won't charge extra for the delivery."
I'll meet you in the middle and pick it up at 52,That'll do fine.

not bad do you think this desk good handle a gaming set up,Easily. It's what I was using it for. I had a dual monitor PC gaming set up running a GTX 1080 ti. I had my mid tower case up on the desk as well and it held it all no problem.
sounds good but im working with a budget so how does 45 sound?,45 is too low. This desk retails for around $250 and the drawers are like $39 retail. I am asking for a price of $75 for the whole thing which is a steal of deal!

I would love to take this off your hands but we are on a tight budget.  Would you be willing to take less?,Yes I am open to making a deal. What is your opening offer?
"HI, this is so cute. How old is it?",3 months. My kid became disinterested so I decided to sell it. It's basically unused.
"Ok, there is a tear in the vinyl an the seat I see there. Any other damage?","no structural damage, just cosmetic."

"Yeah, is there anything wrong with the interior? Or any reason why the miles are so low?",Please note that the listing does say it is a salvage title. The interior is in great condition though!

I'm going to have to get it checked out by a mechanic and I'm  not sure what else I might have to do to repair it, so I think that's what I'd like to pay.",That is far too low. The accident was a small accident and the value is still more than double your offer despite that. Can you make a reasonable offer?
I am willing to pay $552,I see a dresser with mirror
I would like to pay $125,What are you saying?  I'm buying and 125 is not anywhere near the price that we were negotiating..?

Does it have a self timer on it where it takes photos on its own?,"To be honest, I've never used the timer option on it, so I'm not entirely sure. The amount of time I used it was mainly for casual photography."
Oh ok can you do 161?,"$161 sounds like a reasonable offer, you have yourself a deal."
You are welcome. Is the car a 5 speed?,"No, it is automatic."
"Would you accept 17,500?",My listing is only for $13000...are you sure you don't want to go lower?
"Sorry, I thought it said 18,000, lol. Would you accept 6500?","Lol no problem. I can't go that low, but could you do $9000?"
I can do 8500,$8550 and we have a deal
"Yes, I am?  Will this also fit an iPhone 6?","Unfortunately, it will not. Apple changed the body size on the iPhone 6."
That's ok.  I'm still interested.  What is the least you'll take for it?,"If you're willing to pick it up today, I can take $8 for it."
"Hello, I am interested in the poperty, does it come with any additional perks or features?",Well It has beautful appliances. was remodeled and parks up to 3 cars. It also has some nice patio furniture in back.
"Wow that sounds incredible, I am very excited, but the price is a little high for me, can you come down at all?",I could be open to work on the price slightly.
How about 3650 with the furniture included?,Could you do 3730?
"Well that is higher than I would like, would you be willing to cover utilities for 3 months at that price?",That is already a deal the utilities also would be too much. I would do it for 3700 with all the furniture.
Hi yes what is the mileage?,You can come by and see for yourself. The car's features are listed in the ad.
I actually cannot see the mileage,I can send you some pictures later of the dashboard including the mileage.

"Interesting, ok I can come up to 27,000","This car is extremely custom, it's a one of a kind. I can't go below $30,000. I'll give you the warranty papers on all the work that was put in on it."

"Interesting. And it says a three pet minimum, correct?",That's 3 pets max and rent will increase based on the amount of pets you have. I'm asking $1857. Will you be bringing pets?
"No, no pets, but I might in the future. I can pay that much right now, with all the other expenses involved with moving. Can you drop it down to maybe $1200?",That's too low for this great home. I can drop it to $1600 for now and talk pets later when you're ready.
Yes I am. What condition is the bike in?,"excellent condition, barely used at all."
"I see this bike is worth about $160 new, so your asking price is too high.",I think you are mistaken this model is much more new. I am just asking $150.
"I just checked and it's the same exact model selling for $160 new on ebay and amazon. Used they are like $80, will you take 80?","no way, and like I said not possible for this model. I say take your chance on there if you like, sounds like a scam. I can come down slightly to 125 but that is it."
It is definitely the same one with comments from buyers on amazon. Will you take 95?,"I am wanting to get rid of this quickly but feel that is just too low, 115 is my final offer."

What did you originally pay?,I paid $150 for them and I only used them on to flights and put them away.

"Hello, I think I could use your midcentury modern piece if I refinish it.  What are you asking?","This would be a beautiful addition to any room! I'm asking $550, but I'd take $500 if you could pick it up today or tomorrow!"
"That's a little too steep for me.  In antique guides, this is coming in, in perfect condition, at $200-350. Would you take $300 if I pick it up tonight? Cash deal.",A store-bought piece of this style would range you $750-$1000. $350 and we have a deal! $400 and I'll deliver.
"Hi. I'm interested in your item, but looking to pay around 350. 450 sounds a bit steep.",The phone is actually listed at 430 but I might be able to go a little bit lower

"Ok, you have a deal!","Great , thanks"

It would really mean a lot.","I mean the open house is later today, and we have offers at 1750 already. If you can do 1700 cash that's really the only reasonable outcome"

Do you know how long the other owner had it? Are the tires and paint good?,He received it as a Christmas gift in 2016. The paint is in excellent condition. I did not replace the tires before putting it up for sale so I would knock $40 off the price so you can replace them.

"Hello, I'm interested in the 1 BR apt.",Hello
I'm interested in the 1 bedroom unit.,Great...this is a great offer considering the location and facilities
How can the application fees be waived?,I am sorry....application fees cannot be fully waived....but what I can do is offer a 50% cut on that and apply the rest to listing price....basically taking off the application fees
"The ad states ""We'll even waive your application fees"", I assumed that meant it would be waived entirely.",We need to have application fees for administrative purpose...but you are right....we are effectively waiving it off entirely...you will not have to pay it...on top of that we will reduce the listed price by 50% of Application fees
What would I be paying at that point?,With 129 waived....you are looking at a great offer of 1590....this is special price
I would be willing to make a deal at 1590,Thanks....you have made a right choice.
Hi! How are you?,"I'm well, thank you! Yourself?"
"Good, thanks. Let's make a deal! lol","Let's! The batteries are in great condition, I barely used them. Tried it out for awhile and just decided I didn't have the time for it. Normal price is around $250 but I'm willing to let them go for $150"

"Considering it's from Ikea and I could wait for a sale, would you go down on the price with cash in hand?","I understand. I'm asking for $40, but what would you be willing to pay?"
I have $28 and I could be there today and you won't have to deal with tons of people backing out. I'm motivated to buy now.,You're very convincing. I can't go as low as $28. Would $34 work for you?
"Hi, I am very interested in this house.  The pictures are gorgeous.  Is it located in a good area?",It is located in very quite neighborhood
Fabulous.  Are you willing to go down on the price?  I am trying to stay in the $1700 range.,If you have been on your job for a while I can go down to $2220

"OK, I think that 1800 is good enough, you don't really have to add anything.",I'm asking 1900. Can't go any lower.

"I could do 3900 if it had wood or tile in the bedrooms, but with carpet, I would be looking for something more like 3500. I have great references and am an extremely responsible tennant.","well, I can't do that low. if you 2 year leazse, I could to 3800. that's the lowest i can do"

Is the property still available to rent?,"Yes, it has a minimum contract of one year (but I would love a longer contract). I just need your last pay stub and last 2 months of bank statements."

"looks like a nice bedroom set, how long have you had it?",Just a year
"I can find a new set for around 1500, since this is a year old and has a bit of damage how does $800 sound. I can pick it up as well","The estimate cost of the repair should not be more than $250. What id i give that to you plus an additional $150. Making the cost to reduce to $1,250."

"I really like the table and chairs you have posted, is there any chance you would take any less for them?","I'd really like to get $149, but could do $145, if it helps you."

Great deal my friend. Thank you.,You bet!  Enjoy.
Hi; i'd like to make an offer of $2475.,"That's a bit low. This is a great location (near Whole Foods and a lot of nice restaurants, as well as public transportation). I have a lot of buyers interested who are willing to pay more. How about $2600? That's a pretty nice discount from my selling price."
I am loving that bike.  Can you tell me a little more about it?,"Well I bought it a few years ago for my son but he is too big for it so it basically has been sitting in my garage. It is in great shape, no damage."
"Has it been street ridden or more on hills, etc.?  I see it has a Shox seat.",A little of both but only a few times. Very little use.
I'd love to see it.  Only issue is my budget is around $800.  Would you be willing to work with me?,"Yes I can work with you I really have to get rid of it as I am moving. If you can come pick it up, I can let it go for 1000.00"
Would you be willing to split the differnce and do $900?  I'll even stick around and help you load your moving truck.  ;),"Great I could use the help! That would be perfect, you got a deal!"

"Hello, I'm interested in the Jeep you have for sale. How many miles are on it?",It has standard miles for a vehicle of this year. about 120k. Cold A.C. and 80% tire thread. Great shape for a 10 year old jeep.
"Excellent. It is 10 years old though, and based on that mileage, I'm want to pay closer to $2225. I'm willing to negotiate on the price, though.",The blue book value is much higher than that. If you have anything interesting for trade I could accept that and offer the Jeep for $3900.
"I'm sorry, but there are other vehicles I have my eye on, and I'm on a budget. Would you be willing to accept $2670?",If we can agree on an even $3000 we have a deal.
"The most I can spend is $2925, and I can buy it today, cash in hand.",I'm sorry I cant accept that. $3000 is lower than I'm even comfortable to go. I will wait and hear from other interested buyers.

I am very interested but that price is a bit high. What condition is th ebike in,"It's in good condition.  It has always been stored indoors, so no rust or chipping."
Are the tires in good condition? I see they are original ones,"They are the original, but to be honest, I never rode it very often.  There is still a good amount of tread on them, so there's many more miles to go before they'll need to be replaced."
That sounds great. How about we settle for 99 and Ill pick it up today,That works for me!
Is the TV hutch still for sale?,Yes it is!
"Fanstatic, I love the distressed look of it. How heavy is it?","Yeah the distressed look really makes it stand out. The hutch probably weighs around 40 pounds, nothing a dolly couldn't handle."

Hi! I saw you post for the table. How old is it?,Its mid/century but its on perfect conditions.

I'm leaving town soon and this will help fund the move.
"Hi, I saw your ad, but it didn't list a picture. I need a new chest for the backroom but I didn't want to spend over 25 dollars for used IKEA furtniture.",I assure you that the condition is like new. I paid 120 for it so I will not go any lower than $75.
"I could do 50 bucks and pick it up today, but that's really the most I'm able to spend.",$65 and it's yours.

Hello I'm interested in your chair and ottoman. Is it in good condition?,It is! I'm able to deliver to the East Bay or SF area for a small fee if you're interested in that.
I can for sure pick it up myself but thank-you. Would you consider 30 for it in cash? I just moved in and I've got a whole bunch of expenses but I really need somewhere to sit. Right now it's only boxes!,The lowest I can do is $40. The chair isn't very old and it's quite expensive to buy brand new.
Can we meet halfway at 35 cash? I'll pick it up whenever you can!,"Sorry, like I said it's expensive brand new. It's in really good condition and comes from a pet/smoke free home."
I'm going to have to fix the scratches and cover the cushions. I really need it. That 5 dollars makes a huge difference to me.,I'll make you an offer of $40 to which you can accept or deny. That's my final offer as I have other people interested in it as well.
"Hey, can you tell me a little more about the apartment's lease terms? Are they negotiable? I'm a Stanford student and we're on the quarter system, so I would need the lease to continue through the end of June instead of the end of May.",I think we could work something out.  It's only a 30 day extension correct?
"Yes, that's correct.",Will you still want to move in August?
Could I move in September instead? Our classes don't start until mid-September.,September 1 to August 31 I could make that work.  Will it be just for yourself?
"Awesome. I've got three Stanford friends with me, so they'd be in the other bedrooms and would also move in on September 1.",ok.  will you be able to afford $1998 per person per month?
"Honestly that amount is a lot more than I'm comfortable with, since I'm on student loans. But since you're willing to change up the lease terms regarding move-in and move-out date, I can be a little flexible. Could you do $7000 from all four of us, per month?",I can do $7095 per month and all four of you will have to fill out a rental application.  I will go ahead and waive the $35 credit check for each person.  That will save you all $140 on the application process.
Ok that works. Thanks so much.,sure no problem

at this i can only pay about 1600 could you do that,"Unfortunately, that is not a reasonable offer for this area. How long of a lease were you considering?"
6 month,"Hmmm, a longer lease would help us here. How about $2200 for a 16 month lease?"
would you do 1800 for 24 month,"The lowest I could go would be $2000 for a 24 month lease, with a good credit check."
how bout 1900,"We could only do that if you agreed to an increased security deposit of $1000, I think."
how about 1900 a month wilth a securty of 800,"I can't agree to that, unfortunately. It'd have to be $1900 a month with a $1000 security deposit, for a 24 month lease."

Is that something you would consider?","That's a serious offer, but the bike cost far more than that new and it has been maintained properly.

I do. Is the original boxes and paperwork with them? Is there a warranty with the parts that will be transferred to me if I purchase them?,"Everything that came in the box with them is there, I put it all back in after I realized I wouldn't be able to use them on my bike. Unfortunately the warranty for them is outdated by now, they're in new condition, but they've been sitting for a while."
"I am interested in them. However, since the warranty is outdated now, would you be willing to come down on the price?","I am willing to negotiate the price a little lower, that isn't a problem."
"If I agree to pick them up, would you be willing to do $22 considering there is no warranty and they have been sitting for awhile.","$22 is a little bit low for me, but I could definitely come down in price if you do pick them up. How about we meet halfway at $25?"
"Well, it is a bit of a drive for me. I'm sure you want to get rid of these, could you do $23?",I suppose that would be about the price it'd cost to ship them out. You've got yourself a deal bud.
"Hello, do you still have the chargers available?","Yeah, but I'm in a hurry. Its posted for $25, if you can pay now, I'll let it go for $23."
I can only offer $15 at this time.,"Thats too low. I'm assuming you aren't just shopping for chargers, how long can you go without your BlackBerry?"
Long enough to negotiate this deal. 20$ and I'll pay now.,The charger works on three Continents and I'll throw in all of the electrical attachments. $20 works.
Is there anything wrong with this?,Normal wear and tear for an antique. No major issues. It all just adds to the character of the piece.
Okay that's good. Is it heavy or easy to carry?,It is solid oak. You'll need help transporting. This is a generation piece. Your grandchildren will be able to enjoy it.
This all sounds very good to me. I'm willing to give you $85 in cash for it right now.,Deal.

I'll give you $20,That is a bit low. How bout we talk a bit more about it. Trust me.
it's not that fancy and it is used what were you hoping for?,"Well, the asking price is 40 dollars and I am willing to come down a little bit on price. Do you have any questions about this product?"
well a new one is only 32 plus tax on Jet.com so why are you asking for $40?,"That's just where the price started out. Anyways, how about 30 dollars? How does that sound?"

"Hmm, alright. Sounds fantastic! Could you drop the price to $40 and I'll come over today with cash and pick it up in my truck? What do you say?",how about 42?
"I only have $40 in my wallet besides maybe some quarters, I don't really want to be bothered to find $2 somehow or stop at a store to break a $20 after I stop by the bank, just too much of a hassle. $40 is good, yea?","ok, 0 will do. what's your PHONE#?"
hello I am interested in the bike you are selling,Awesome!! It's a great bike and I haven't had it for a long time so it's in pretty new condition
Is it a street bike?,yes  I use it to commute to work so I avoid driving my car
I'd like to offer $100,I can't do 150 since it's such a good bike...
125? or do you have any supplies to throw in with it?,I can give you my chain that I use to lock it up at work so it's not stolen and I can do $130 and deliver it tonight
"Hi, I'm interested in buying this. How many devices can it charge at a time?","You can only charge 1 thing at a time, but you can charge a phone while you plug a different phone into the AUX-in to use it."
"That's not ideal, but I guess it'll work. Would you be willing to accept $25 for this since it's used?","I can do 30 if you pick it up from me, or $40 if I drop it off at your place. I'm afraid I can't go any lower though, as $25 would be a little too low."
I can pick it up for $30!,Awesome! See you soon!

Has it had any damage from flooding or accidents?,No damage. It has only been driven a short distance to and from work everyday. One owner. It also has a backup camera.
I was looking at your bed. It says you kept a mattress protector on it the whole time?,Yes it was in the guest room so this mattress is like brand new. Only slept on once by some guest. I paid over 2000.00 for it.
Wow would you say it is firm or not?,It is firm but not like a brick.  It is actually very comfortable as I have one in my wife and my room too.
I know your bed is a great deal at 900 but I do not have that much now. Would you consider 500.00?,If you can pick it up I can do $500.
"Hey, I just saw your post about the front wheel. I was looking to talk to you about it!","Hello. I do still have the front wheel for sale, what would you like to know?"

At a good price as well. However I am short $5. Is there any we could work out a deal for $45?,You know I think I could do $5 less. In that case you'd have to make the drive and come pick them up. Does that work for you?
"hi, this looks like a nice bike.  what is the least you will accept for it?",Well it's in perfect working order so I'd like to get $200. I've always kept it inside.
My budget is tight but I would love to buy this bike for my grandson.  Would you take 150?,"That's just a little lower than what I was thinking, could you do $160. I'll even deliver it to you."

"I see that, does the keyless entry and remote start work correctly? ANy problems I should be aware of?","It works great, I have a spare remote for it too and that works great, but it's not a factory original. Other than the damage on the passenger door it's in great shape."
I am definitely interested would 7000 be good?,"Sorry, even with the door damge it's only 4 years old and is worth more than the $13,000 I'm asking."
"I suppose. I guess I could go to 12000, are you interested in selling it for that?",I could sell it for that for sure. do you want me to meet you half way to pick it up or are you local?
"I am local, I can get my friendto drop me off with the cash and I can drive it home.",Great
"This isn't a dresser, it is a bike that I see...",You're right. The dresser is my other advertisement
I can offer 100$,That works. Okay then.
"Hey, I'm interested in the bicycle you posted. Is it still available?","It is still available. I'm looking to sell it for $90. It is a very high end bike, but considering it needs a back brake cable and new chain (both of which are very inexpensive), I lowered the price to $90"
That seems likre a reasonable price. Any other defects that weren't noted? Do you know the chain size as well so I can pick one of thoe up?,Everything else is good to go on it. I have kept it in excellent condition. I can get the chain size for you before you come pick it up.
"Hello, I am interested in your bike. What condition is it in? How well does it ride?",Its in a good condition and rides very well
That's good. I can't afford $100 for it. Would 60 work with you?,I could do $80 plus pick up!
How about $70. I'll come and pick it up and then ride it home.,okay then but you will have to pay me right away?
I can do that.',okay then you got a deal!
"Hi there, I'd like to offer 3,000.",ok so you cant just make an offer on the right thats the final agreement box. We have to negotiate in the chat first then arrive at a price and then one of us can post the negotiated price or the only price we will accept on the right. They might reject the hit with the way you did it.
I'm interested in the radio you have for sale.,"Hi, I'm looking to get $25.00 for the radio.  It's in good condition."
"I see a piece of trim is missing, can you tell me where? Is it visible or in the back?",It is missing a small trim piece on the back. The missing piece isn't visible.
would you be willing to go a little lower since it is missing that piece?,"I priced pretty low due to the missing trim piece.  I would be willing to lower the price a little bit, if you're interested.  How about $22?"
"I can pick it up now, I have cash in hand. Would you do $15?","How about you pick it up now, pay with cash for $18?"
"Hey, would you accept a price of 1975? The yard doesn't look great so I would have to spend time on it to make it better.",I could get some cheap labor and a days work to get that lawn looking spiffy in no time. I could renegotiate to 2400 plus a redone lawn

Are you flexible with the price? This vehicle is 11 yeard old,What are you looking to pay?
"I can come pick it up right now, all cash for $5,000","Thats a bit extremely low, this is coming from the dealership so the prices are quite higher...I was thinking more along the lines of 9,000"
"For a vehicle that is 11 years old $9,000 seems like a lot of money. Especially since the AD that I saw showed the price at $8,500","If you can come up with the cash, I can do it for 8,000"
"The most I can do is $7,750, would you be willing to accept that?",Seems fair
Very much so. I want in my house now. I need to get some more info on it though. do you know how old it is?,It's an antique in beautiful condition. It was hand crafted in the 1960s.
is it in a house or a warehouse or store. Also it must be pretty heavy do I get free delivery with that?,It is located at our warehouse in Vallejo. Delivery is $25.
I really need this peice in my home are you willing to let it go for $65 and I will pick it up today .,I can't let it go for that low. What I can do though is sell it at list price of $95 and throw in free delivery. I can have our crew bring it into your house to ensure no damage.

"Sounds great. Would you be willing to accept $16,499 for the car?","That is well under my listing price, this car has been completely disassembled and painted by Phantasy Kolors."
"I understand. Maybe we can come to an agreement. How would $22,000 work?","That is still substantially beneath my listing price. I am not sure the amount of additional features that aree included with this car are being valued. Friend, Xenon headlights, cat back exhaust, carbon fiber racing seats, carbon fiber engine bay, accu airabagged solution. Surely these add value to the price, can you do 31,000?"
"Yes, all of those definitely add value. I can do $28,000 at the most.","Well since neither of us will be completely satisfied lets split the difference and agree to 29,500. I will include a mechanics warranty for a year."
Hello I want to move in is there a deposit?,Yeah I have the following room available currently you can find the description below.
I want the house can I at least supply my own stove and refrigerator and etc and pay my utilies if I can get the rent lowered,"I can provide all the stuff you don't need to get them on your own, how much can you pay ?"

"Hi, was this painted black or was it origianlly black?",Painted black
"And I can see there are a few scratches on this side, how about hte other side and the top?",Everything else is good to go
Ok. I was wondering if you would accept $24 for it,"Whoa, that's way too low. I can go down to $30"
"I don't know those scratches look pretty big, so I am going to have to repaint it and that's time and money.",Submit an offer and I'll accept or reject
Well I would like to know if you will come down to $24?,"Submit an offer and I'll either accept or reject, but choose wisely otherwise we both lose out on real money"
so why not work out an offer here and now to ensure we are both paid?,Because time is of the essence
Agreed. So you agree to $24?,Offer submitted - accept or reject
"Hi, I'm interested in the truck, how many miles on it?","Hello, it has 20040 miles. Its in perfect condition!"

Oh that's good. Can you tell me more about the bike? What is the condition? How old is it?,This bike is fairly new and in like new condition. I only used this bike for one season. It has been kept in the garage and is in perfect condition.
So the listing says it was repainted is that correct? was that because of wear and tear? Are there scratches?,This bike has never been repainted and there are absolutely no scratches. I'm only selling this bike because I recently got married and we are expecting our first child.
Okay well could you work with me on the price a little?,"Yes I can.. I can accept $1,600 .. A great price being this bike sells new for 4 grand, and was only taken out last spring and used one season only.. No more than 10 times has the bike been ridden.."

How many miles does it have?,"The  mileage is 100,000"

Are you smoker? I'm allergic to cigarette smoke.,"You don't have to worry, I have never smoked a day in my life. The interior is perfect."

Is there any wear and tear on the item?,"Virtually no wear and tear, none you can see."
Okay would you take $40 for it,"That is too low, can you go up to 50 at least?"
I am.  What price are you willing to part with it for?  It's a bit much for me tbh,Hm. I can go down to $315?
I was thinking more along the lines of 285.  What do you think?,"285 is too low, I cannot turn a profit. I bought this item for $500 and am already losing money as it is. I can go to $300, take it or leave it."

That sounds great. I travel for work so that is very important. Are the tires new or will I need to replace them shortly if I purchase  the car?,"its a 2016. The tires are spectacular! Its only got 8k miles on engine, so there is a ton of tread left for you to coast through the sunset with. You're also getting keyless entry in this model as well as ALL leather interior."
It doesn't get better than that. Would you consider taking $19000 for the car so some funds are left over for taxes and registration?,"How bout we settle for 20,000 BUT,  Ill add a bluetooth adaptor and mood lighting in the vehicle Before i hand you the keys"
"Hello, I am interested in your lamp.","Hi, I still have two available. They are in excellent condition."

I really need this vehicle to be mobile but I already have so many expenses so I can't afford the asking price of $3000.  Would you be willing to take $2000 if I paid in cash?,$2700 is the lowest I can possibly go. I've put a lot into the car and it shouldnt have any issues or need any major upkeep for the next 50k miles
$2300 is the absolute highest I can go.  I've been looking at another hand controlled equiped car for $2200 but it has slightly more miles.  I may have to go with that one if you can't take my offer,"I can go to $2500 if you can come today, but that is the absolute lowest.

I'll take it for $2500,Deal!

"Hey, I'm interested in this item but I'm on a budget. Is your list price your final offer?",This bike is a great deal as you can see from the description.  I feel as though $800 is a reasonable asking price considering the high end components.
"The frame looks great, but I'm concerned about maintenance costs and more fragile components.",Would you be interested if I delivered it to you for free and dropped the price to $775?
"Free delivery is a perk to me, but I think the parts you've listed are only worth about $500.","That is a very big discount.  I will add free delivery, maintenance for three months and a final price of $750."
That's not a very big price drop. What about $600?,The lowest I will go is $700 and no other perks.
That's just too high for me. Are you sure?,$700 is more than fair.
"Can you tell me anything more about the bike that will convince me of that? All I see is a 2009 aluminum frame, the crankset, and the handlebars and stem.","It has Shimano Devore XT crankset, Ritchie's Comp handlebars and stem, Avid Juicy 7 Hydrolic Disc Brakes.  These are all high end components."
"Ah, I didn't know about the brakes! That makes a big difference for me. I'm willing to pay $650, in cash if you'd prefer, and pick it up myself.",$690 and it is yours.
"Are you willing to go just a bit lower, perhaps $675?","Ok, it's a deal at $675!"
"I agree! But for some reason, I can't submit the offer from my end. Are you able to do so?","Yup, I'm submitting right now."
"Hey, you have a car charger?","Yes I do.  $10, and it charges one device and allows a second to charge with a USB port."

"Yes, what kind of condition is it in?",The item is in great condition i will also include two covers for it and deliver it to you
Wow that's great. Would you consider taking $110 for it?,Yes i would accept that if I can deliver it today for you
hello yes the place isn't too bad. I would really like to know more information about it though,What would you like to know?
Hi. I'm interested in the Samsung Galaxy Note if you can negotiate on the price.,The item works great and is in mint condition.      I can toss in an Otter Box Case for it  and a 64gb Sd Card to expand the memory on the device. . .. .. .  and also delver it directly to you saving you some more time and money for $375
"I'm not interested in paying for all of those additions, especially not $35 over the listing price. 32gb a great perk, I can go as high as $225 with the 64gb sd card you mentioned.","Im confused,  how is an $89.99 Otter Box Case and a $39.99 sd card  for an additional $35 a bad deal?     If those items dont interest you that fine, but lets not blow smoke up our keesters about the value in my items for sale please.

How does 5500 sound? That is within my budget.,It sounds way too low.  If you come up some more I'm sure we can meet in the middle somewhere.
How about 8000? That seems like a good meeting point for us.,I think we can meet more at 9000.  I just put 4 new tires on it.
8700 and not a penny higher. How does that sound to you?,"Well...you will have to pay for the title transfer, plates and pick it up.  I guess we can do 8700."
How bout we go to 8800 then?,You're only 200 away from the 9000 I was asking!!!

"Ok. Are you willing to take $15500? I can have a buddy come with me to pick it up, so you don't have to worry about moving it anywhere.",I can't go that low. I could do 19000 but no extra transmission at that price.
"Ok. Since you want 19000 and I want 15500, let's meet in the middle and settle on 17250, with no extra transmission. That way we both get what we want. How does that sound?",I'll go 17250 with no warranty and no extra transmission.
How about 18000 and include the warranty?,Ok I'll do that.

Oh ok..are you willing to take any lower?,I would like to get $3000 out of it at least..  Has many upgrades to it.

"Sounds good! Unfortunately I'm on a really tight budget. I""m a college student looking for a reliable ride. Would you take $4250 for the car?",I understand your situation. I also have a college student which is why I need to sell this car. We are downsizing to a one car family. The lowest I can go is $6900.
"Sounds like we're in the same boat. If I hit up my parents for a loan, I might be able to go up to $5900, but I don't think I could do much more, especially since it's 12 years old.",Its very low mileage for that age. I'll take $6100 but that has to be a firm deal. I'll throw in a gas card for $50.

"I understand that.     How about for a title for title swap,    Ill trade you the Izuzu Rodeo for your Chevy Blazer  and in addition pay you $1000 cash?     :)",Are you okay if the blazer isn't tuned?
I can do the standard Tune Up on the Blazer myself. . . .. .  and for the deal your cutting me the low cost of a tune up is no issue and my pleasure.     :),"Hmm, sounds good.  If you can pick it up I'll give it to you for the trade and 1000"

"I am definitely interested in the TV, but it being 10 years old has me a bit skeptical. How does the TV look running movies and games, if you don't mind me asking.",It's full HD at 1080p and it looks great. The TV works like it is brand new. I'll throw in a DVD player that was hooked up to it for the same price of $275
"The DVD player sounds nice, but unfortunately I'm on somewhat of a budget. Would you be willing to drop the price a tad, maybe $230?","$230 is kind of low. I'll tell ya what, if you come pick it up where it is located I'll sell it for $260"
"Throw in a couple of movies with that DVD player,and you have yourself a deal.",Deal.
"Hello, I am very interested in buying your bike.",Great! It is a perfect bike!
Are there any parts of the bikes that are still broken?,"No parts that are broken, I fixed it all up. it may need some TLC with the shifter in the next year or so. Other than that, it is in sound, working condition."
"That's great, how old is it?",I have owned it for year. The owner before me bought it brand new. It is twenty years old.
"Ok this all sounds fine, but do you think you could come down to about $45?","I really cannot. I put original handlebars on it and new fenders, each easily cost more than $45 each. I could go down to $65, but that is about it. It is a great piece and needs a home to be used in!"
Hello there!,Hi are you interested in the bed?
"Yes I am, I'm familiar with the Ikea portion of the furniture, but what can you tell me about the teal headboard? What did you pay for that?",Well it is very sturdy and well cushioned.  I bought it as a set for just over $1800 a year ago for a spare bedroom.  I had relatives comming to visit and needed it.  It was used for only 5 nights.
"Oh really, wow okay. And does the headboard and frame collapse so you can move it in and out of the room easily?",yes the headboard does unscrew from the frame I want to say there are 4 screws on each side.
"Ok, great. I was going to try to talk you down to $450 or so but this is basically brand new if it's really only been used for 5 nights. How is $800 so I can use the $800 to rent a truck?","Oh you don't have a truck?  I do so how about this, for 850 you load it in my truck I can drive it to your house and you unload it there.  I just can't move or deliver by myself as I am 8 months pregnant so no lifting."
Hi can you tell me something about this item?,"It's in good condition. The back adjusts to three positions. And I have a futon pad, too, if you would need one."
Well...it's a little out of my price range. I have my own mattress. Could you take 15.00?,No. That's less than half of what I'm asking. How about $35?
I could do 35.00 if you can deliver it.,"Could you give me some gas money, also, say ten bucks?"
"No, I can 30 and pick it up myself.",How about $34 and you pick it up?
I think I'm being more than fair offering 30.00,"I'll meet you in the middle. How about $32 and I'll deliver it free, not asking for gas money."

How old is the home? how many families have lived in it?,There was only one family before ours the home was built recently. It was built in 1998. There is not much wear on the house. This also means that there will not be any lead paint on the walls if you have little ones.
"Nice, is there any way I can get you to go down on the price?",How low are you thinking. I can't go too low because I am wanting someone to take over the payments.
"Ah, I was thinking $1160, I own a grocery store and I'm low on cash right now, but if you accept that I can give you a certificate for $1000 in product.",That is a bit too low for me could you do $2000?
"Alright, tell me more about the amenities of the home and I will think about it.",The A/C unit was replaced two years ago so it is working great. As you can see in the picture the kitchen is up to date. There are hardwood floors throughout the house. There is also a nice size yard of 1 acre that is fenced in.
"I love the car, are you still selling it?","Yes at a give away price of $15,000. Everything works okay just like new"
How many miles does she have on her?,"Do not drive it all the time. I has just 75,000"
I was hoping to make $7500 offer on the 2005 model. What do you think?,"Great but too low. Add $5000 and i can give it away at $12,500"
Does it hae any more perks that would make that a good deal?,"Its a great care. I recently serviced it, Changed the tyres and have a brand new spare tyre. The insurance on it was just renewed too. Its a great deal i suppose"
Ok I will take the deal then.  Thank you.,Thanks

Could you drop it 20 bucks? I'd love to have  it but 185 is just over my budget,$165 sounds good
Yes can you tell me why you are selling?,It is a tire conversion kit. It helps to maintain your tire and ensure it has longer lifetime
Do you not need it anymore?,I bought an extra last week and apparently I don't need it anymore. It is new.
Will you take $30 for it?,maybe I can take $35

why was it given a salvage title? how bad was the wreck? Does anythgin rattle when you drive it?,Car has salvage title due to minor dins and scratches. I do have pictures from the accident. The car was not worth more than the damages so the insurance company wrote it off as salvaged. If you can pick it up tonight with cash in hand (after test driving it) I will let it go for $7000
"I'll give you cash, I come and pick it up. 6800. if that's ok we have a deal",Deal!

"OK, Is the IOS up to date?",It has IOS 10.3.2
Would you be willing to sell for 200?,I cannot go that low. The phone is in good shape and it has a new screen with protector and it is completly clean
Do I have to pay for shipping?,"It depends on where you are located. If you are local, I can deliver."
I can do 250 then,"I was looking to get a little bit more for it then that, considering it can be used on any network. How about $300 with overnight shipping"
"I really can't go that high and I need a good phone, 260?",I can do $275 with standard shipping.
275 and you deliver tomorrow,I cant do the delivery tomorrow with that low of a price. This is a great phone and you would get a lot of use out of it.
"Yea, I really need it so you have a deal!",Great
"Hi, can you tell me how long you've had it? Is it in good shape?","I have had it about 3 years, its in great shape everything is working, the tires, the rims,"
So nothing would need replaced?,no it's in awesome shape and I am asking $250 for it
"Are you flexible on price? I really like it, but its a little out of my price range.",yes I'm flexible make me an offer.
"Hello there, i'm very interested in the device, but I'm not sure I can afford it. Would you be willing to accept a lower offer?",Hi there! Yes I am open to negotiating :)
I'm assuming this phone doesn't have any damage as you state it is relatively new. It's in good working order then?,Yes it is absolutely in a good working condition and has no scratches or anything. It was always used with the cover and its as new.
"Great, well I'm a bit strapped for cash, so how about $25 in cash.",Woah! That's too too low. I am selling it for 70$. I can go up to $65
I wouldn't have enough money left over for other things at that price. Could you take $40,I can take $50
"Yes, it looks very nice. Is it furnished?","It sure is, We just recently remodeled, and included some appliances. We have an AC unit, a fridge, a stove, and a washer and dryer!"
Awesome! Are any utilities included like cable or electric?,Unfortunately you will have to do all utilities on your own aside from water.
"Okay, that's understandable. Is it well or city water there?",Municipal city water.
"I know you're asking for $2750, but would you be able to come down closer to $1900?",We could work something out. The $2750 asking price has your first 5 months included. Were you looking to go for a lower price for fewer months?
I may be interested in 4 months but does that price include a security deposit?,"The way our company works is that our security deposit is just one month of rent. the added payment is to ensure that you will in fact be living there for that period of time. If you wanted 4 months, I could do $2000, and that price includes the deposit."
"Seeing as it is furnished and the price includes the deposit, I think 4 months at $2000 is a decent price.",Excellent. Feel free to call the head office if there is anything else you would need. Enjoy your stay with us!
"hi, i like the description of your bike, what's your best price",I'm looking for at least $270.
"ok.. since there are no pictures, i have to double check about the condition",I can understand that. I'll be here all weekend. Do you want to tentatively say $270 and you can look at it tomorrow? I'll have it ready to go for you if you choose to buy it tomorrow.
i can do 250... or if you can throw in a helmet i can do 270. i would like to take a test ride though before paying you. if you agree i can come down tonight!,I can do $270 with a helmet! Tonight works for me.
Hello!  I am interested in the couch.  Any smells or pet hair on it?,None at all. I have no pets and i don't smoke.
Would it fit in the backseat of my Toyota Corolla and/or trunk or would I need to utilize a truck or SUV?,"You would need an open bed truck, it is not a small couch."
"Since I would need to utilize a truck and pick it up, would you be willing to accept 550?",I could do $550
Hi!!  I am!   Any scratches or dents?  Powers on?,It powers on perfectly has no internal issues at all. There are no scratches it has a screen protector and has been in an otterbox case since I got it.
Would you take  $237 cash for it todsy ?,"It's worth the $340, but i could go as low as 250 and it comes with the otterbox case."
I am very interested!  Would you be willing to take $4000 cash?,"I'm sorry but thats simply way too low. I'm looking for around double that, if you can do that. This truck jsut had a cleaning and tune up/ transmission flush a week ago, its only 138k miles"
"It seems to be in decent shape, but it's also 10 years old with almost 150k miles.  I'd be willing to come pick it up... How about $4400?","That's just out of the picture dude sorry. Ill send you my final offer, and just know, this is a great deal, way lower than I would get normally."

How easy is it to change the seat to a wide and more comfortable version?,"Hi! On something like the Surly Long Haul Trucker, parts are super interchangeable. That's just a matter of finding the seat you want and a couple minutes of your time."
Oh that is great to know! If i pick the item up are you willing to come down in price?,"Yeah, the price is definitely flexible if you have cash and can buy it soon."
"Hi! Yes, I am wondering if it is pet friendly.","It is pet friendly, but there are some restrictions. What kind of pet(s) do you have?"
One dog. She's about 45 pounds,A dog would be fine to have at the apartment.
Great! Are any utilities included in the monthly cost?,They are not included. We do include free internet at the building though.
"Hmmm. Okay, what is the deposit? And is there an application fee? If so, can it be waived if I'm a full time student?",The deposit will be the same as the first months rent. I would not include an application fee since you are a full time student.
Okay. Thank you for that.,"No problem. We also have a pet fee, but I would be willing to waive that also. Are you interested in renting this unit?"
Hello! I am interested in you Cannondale Ironman bike,Is this your first Sports Bike?
No I have one other bike!,"Wel I tell you, You are going to love this one... This girls been really fun..."
howdy nice bike you got there,Thank you it has been great for me but I got a new one so time for someone else to enjoy it.
So most of its accessories don't work?,Yes that is true and I did take that into account when I was trying to figure out how much to ask for it.
"Fair enough. Tell you what, I'll give you 75 cash, i'll even come and pick it up. you ain't gotta lift a finger.",Well I already have an offer for 175 but they can't pick it up till next week.  Can you get closer to that?
Yeeesh man. that's still pretty steep. i could do 100? still the same deal. I pick up,I have to have atleast 125.  I can't go any lower than that but I can thrown in a spare tire set of tires that I have for it.
Yes I am. How old is it?,It's under a year old. Probably around 8 months.
Does it come with warranty?,"It doesn't have a warranty, but I can tell you it's showing no signs of wear and is fully tested and working."
I am not able to come pick it up and test it so I will have to get it threw UPS so I can offer you $50 for it.,If you can meet me in the middle at 75 you got yourself a deal.
I can't because my car is not working. I can do 60.,if you can pay shipping it's a deal!
"Hi, I am interested in the bike you have for sale, can you tell me a bit about it...","It's a 20.75 inch top tube Fit Bike VH2. Very good condition, no rust, but does have a few scratches from use."
How old is it?,It's a year old. Bought it brand new last July
"That all sounds pretty good, would you be willing to negotiate on the price, I can pick it up in person if that helps...","I'm asking $250 for the bike, and pick up would be ideal"
"Hmmm the list price says 200, and I was hoping to get it for less than that...",I can go down to $175
I was thinking closer to 150 would be more fair...,How about $160?
"Hi, I am interested in your iPhone. Would you be willing to negotiate a lower price?","Yes absolutely I can negotiate. The phone is in great shape, it is like new. I cannot ship it though, you'd have to pick it up."
That wont be a problem. I can come pick it up as soon as today if that works for your schedule. Does the phone come with any additional accessories or chargers?,"Yeah it comes with a charger, a package of film screen protectors and a simple plastic case."
"So this is a one-bedroom, one bath, right?",yes. pool in the complex. newly remodeled
"$1395 -- basically $1400 -- is pretty steep for a one-bedroom, without washer or dryer in-apartment. Coin laundry has a tendency to add up. I've paid $1000 for a one-bedroom in San Francisco, on Nob Hill. I'm pretty sure I could find a two- or three-bedroom for $1400. But, I like the granite kitchen. And the pool is a good perk.","Nob Hill isn't very desirable. This one is located near shops, and a bus stop,. it will give you all the convenience you seek. So you need to pay a bit more for that"
"I mean. Nob Hill is right in the middle of town. There was a great bodega right across the street; the BART was a ten-minute walk away. I can go for $1200 on this, all things considered. The perks do push it up a bit.",tell you what. sign a one year lease and i'll let you have it for 1250 a month
"Hi, I'm interested in your tandem bike.","Hello, the price is $3000. It iis in good condition and trunks to hold items while you are riding."

"Cool, is your price fixed or can you come down some?  It's a little out of my price range/","You can make me an offer if you'd like.  I am pretty firm on the 3000 range, I could come down a tad bit."
"I have $2280 cash, I could come get it today.",$2280 is too low.  Could you do more like 2750?
That's just too high for my budget.  Can you come down any lower?,$2700 is my absolute lowest.
Can you deliver it for that price?,Yes
"Hi, I'm interested in the 2001 Rav 4",It is a great car. It runs great. I'm asking $4000.
"That's way out of my budget, plus it seems a bit steep for such an old car.","It may be old, but it runs great. Has lower mileage and a clean title."
Why are you selling it?,I'm going to get a motorcycle instead. How much are you willing to pay?
"I'm very interested, but it's out of my price point. I'd like to pay around 2,500 for my next car.","You can't get a car like this for that low. I checked the Blue Book, and what I'm asking is right in range. I'll tell you what. I have a friend who is a mechanic. If you give me $3500, I'll have him check it out for you for free."
"I could go up to $3,000",How about $3400?
"Believe me, I wish I had that much saved. The absolute highest I could go is $3,200","No, too low. I'm close to the Blue Book value. If you pay $3400 and something goes wrong in the next three months, I'll refund your money. You rarely get a warranty like tha!"
"Yes, hows the floor",It;s laminate flooring
How's the area,It's very quiet but urban
"If I pay a years worth of rent up front, can I do 2500?",I can do 18 months for 2700

"Hi, I see your trying to sell a pretty decent but very old high mileage Mazda.",Yes indeed it has 170000 miles but will go 170000 more because of the care I've put into it! It is in absolutely PRISTINE condition!
"I'm really only looking to pay about 1600 though, I can get something much newer for what your asking.",Thats a little bit too low i would be willing to meet you at 2000 if you can do that.
I am very interested in this girls bicycle.,i will sell it for 90 if you can come pick it up today and throw in a bike helmet included
Hello. How long have you had this bike?,I have had it for only a year. It is in great shape.
Do you do better offers?,"I have it set at 250 dollars, but I am willing to lower it a bit for you."
I have $175 in cash on me right now. I,"How bout 200 and I will deliver it to you, so you can come up with more cash?"
"Does the bike have any rusting, scratches, or anything at all this is less than ideal?",It is in great condition. No scratches or anything.
"Ok, I can do $200 if you deliver it to my house",Sounds good. Good doing business with you.
"Hi, is the charger brand new?",Yes
"I've read that some of these portable chargers can even jump a car, can this one do that?","Frankly, I'm not sure but I doubt it..."
"Okay, do you have one? And if so how does it perform?","Yes, I got this as a present and I already had one.  It's for cell phones primarily and has worked well for me!"
Great! Can you come down to $11?,"Sure, that's fair.  When can you meet?"
Now!,Alright!  See you soon!
"Hi, this is my final offer",sorry i can't except that offer my offer is $700
Hi there. I'm interested in the apartment.,"Hi, the price is $2150. These apartments are gorgeous. They are newly renovated with on site washers and dryers."
What about amenities? Does the price include amenities?,"Yes, and we have energy efficient appliances."
"Well I am a broke student, and $2150 seems like a lot. Especially since it's for an apartment.",We have multiple bedrooms. You could have some of your college friends move in with you and split the rent.
"Sure, but this needs to be just for me. Is there any way I could talk you into dropping it to $1500?",If your credit check is approved I can agree on that price.
how many bed rooms,3 bedrooms
where is it located,newhall park and turtle creek rd
how many baths,2.5 .. the master has its own bath ... the main restroom has his/her sinks
would you take 2200,2800.00 is an extremely fair price for both the house and the area.  I think 2200.00 is not comparable to the comfort this house will provide your family
right now all i can do 2300 with 500 depost,I understand. thank you for hour interest.
ok 2500,the best I can do is 2700.00 and an equal deposit.
ok 2700,"with a 2700.00 deposit, correct?"
yes,perfect. i'll send you the lease agreement.
Hello! I saw your ad and thought this would be a great gift for my grandmother!,"Thats Great, This bike was my grandfather and we would love to pass it to a good family. do you want to pick it up"
I would love to come and check it out. Would you be willing to negotiate on price?,Yes. If you are willing to get the bike today I can let it go for $220
I was hoping to go closer to $150?,Well this bike is still in good condition and is a single gear with custom paint.

"Hello, I am interested in your bike.  Are you negotiable on the price?",I am negotiable on the price.
"Hello, I am interested in buying your product.","It is a beautiful leather cushion bar stool, swivel, supportive, and adjustable height as well."
"That's good, is it in decent condition?","It is only a year old, so it is gently used and no tears.  It is quite beautiful. I am asking $300"
"I think the chair looks great, but can you go a little lower on the price?",The lowest I can go is $250 if you come pick it up for me.
Are pets allowed?,"Yes, this a pet friendly community."
Are utilities included?,As in what? The house comes with appliances.
"Am I responsible to pay monthly utility fees; such as: water, electricity, garbage?",Those are included in the listing price.
Would you accept an offer of $2760?,"I would accept $2,850"
"If I entered a contract for 1 year, as opposed to a month-to-month contract, would you accept $2,760?",Yes I would accept that deal.
"Hi, I'm interested in the Land Rover",great.
How many miles does the vehicle have on it?,135k
"That seems pretty high, would you be willing to drop the price due to the number of miles?",Maybe a little. What is your offer?
How about $2100 and I'll pay you cash and drive it away today.,I could go down to maybe 2800.
That might be a little higher than the vehicle is worth.  How about $2400 and you get the oil changed before I pick it up?,"I'm pretty sure I can sell at closer to 3000. If you come today, I'll give it to you for 2750."
That still is a little high for me.  I can pay you in cash if you come down to $2600.  you won't have to worry about cashing a check.,I'm not going below 2750. Final offer.
"I really like the vehicle, but I can't go over $2,600 which is a fair price for that vehicle.",well here's the deal take it or leave it.
Yes. But I am looking to pay only $1530,You can't just put an offer we need to discuss it first
I only think it is worth 1530,"okay I can accept that, but you will have to pay me in cash right away?"
I can do that.,great then we got a deal
"Hi, how are you today?","Hi, I'm good.  How about you?"
I am great! I'm very much interested in your ford fiesta! are there any issues?,Glad to hear it.  No issues with my car.  In fact it has every option that was available at the time I purchased it.  I'm just looking for something bigger right now which is why I'm selling it.
"I would really love this car, but it seems to be priced a bit high. are you willing to go a bit lower?","Like I mentioned, the car is fully loaded, low mileage, black rims, bluetooth, Sony sound, key less entry and I had mood lighting added to it as well."
"Yeah, it looked to be in great condition. If you bring the price down to 18,000 i can come pick it up tonight","You seem like a nice person so I think we can work something out.  How about 18,599?"
"okay, great. I will be bringing cash tonight.",I'd really prefer a cashiers check.  Thanks!  We've got a deal!
how does it ride,Hi. This is a beautiful classic car. They don't make them like this anymore. And a steal at $20000
are you the original owner,"I rebuilt this baby on my own. Using all original parts, have certification on everything. It rides smooth, like buttah,"
so thats only one owner,"Well. It probably had more owners before me, but she started as just a frame, so I am the only one that deove this version."
how is 15000,I can't go that low. This is a classic. Freshly waxed and detailed. I will do 17500.
"I don't know what CDs are, but I think this would make a great addition to my antique display","Yeah, there's also an 8-track hidden compartment in the back!"

Great!  And all maintenance has been kept up on it?  Why is it a fun car?,"Yes, I have paperwork showing all required maintenance has been kept up on it. It is my little ""joy ride"". I use to take it out for a weekly country drive to just get away."

beautiful couches! Yes I am interested. These are real leather?,"Yes sir, the pillows aren't included but the whole set matches a new apartment well. How do you feel about 450?"
"Ouch, that's a little high. We are just starting off.. Could you go lower, say.. $350?",It's a lot of furniture for so low of a cost. Give me 400 and I'll throw in two of those pillows.
"Alright, I can do that. They really are lovely!","I agree! Thanks for working with me on this. Have a wonderful day, and I hope your apartment fills out nicely."
Yes I see that. It looks like it's in great condition. So the CC swiper is brand new?,"Yeah it's never been used. It was an extra, it didn't work with our setup."
"Ah gotcha, well everything is exactly what I'm looking for. Would you be willing to take $150 if I come and pick it up from you today?","I don't know that's pretty low, how about $180. I can give it to you for $150 without the Cc swiper."
"I'm really interested in this apartment, specifically the 2 bedroom. Could you tell me how many units you have open?",We have several units.  Starting at 1898.00
That seems overpriced. Could you do $949?,Since the deposit and first month is already paid I can go $1500
"I am interested, is was this owned by a single owner or multiple owners?",it belonged to my father other than he and I no one else.
its pretty old and would need some work. would you be willing to accept $2900,yes it is old but it is a Jaguar. No other car maintains it's value like a Jaguar. In a few years it will be a classic. 3500 is a great offer!
hello?,hi
"yeah, so $3000 for the jaquar? It needs a tune up, and some work",I can go to 3250 but even then that's rock bottom. This car is a classic.

I only have 140 in my budget,How about 142? I am including other items.
"Hello, I am interested in the office furniture you're selling","Great to hear it is still available.  I would say it is in decent condition, there are a few scuffs along the bottom but that is it."
I'm interested in the hutches. Would you take $20 for them?,"Well they are already quite discounted because I need them gone, would you be willing to come up to $23"
I can come pick them up if you'd take $21 for them.,Well as long as you can come soon I can do that.

i need them badly however I have a little financial problem ;),"I'm flexible on price, how much are you thinking?"
"i am thinking towards the nine hundred area , is that good for you?",I can't go quite that low. How about we meet in the middle at $1000?
"I would be willing to do that  if you deliver it to me , because I am 200 miles out, ok","Yes, I can definitely do that."
"Hello, I'm interested in buying your truck.",Great! It is a great shape and runs great.
Yes. It is in very good condition.,"It has full power, and ac and extras. I am asking 13000."
I do love to gold but I am concerned with how much traffic will be near the house and the privacy. Does the gold course cover repairs should a golf ball break one of our windows?,"I don't think that will happen (damage from golf balls) as it's not directly on the course and there are many trees lining the properties. You will have a nice view though and I suppose a ball may come through that clearing. If that shall happen, I will cover the costs of repair. Traffic wont be an issue as the entrance to the course is on the other side of town"
"Seeing as there are no pictures this is quite a risky chance I am taking, so I would be willing to pay $1350 with a 1 month security deposit (refundable).",I can do that! Would you like to come sign the lease today?
how long have you had the bike?,17 years. I bought it when it was new. The bike's still in great condition.
"But it's quite old... tell you what, i'll might consider it for 200",It's a sought after color. How about $210?
"hey, i would love to buy your vehicle. but with all the work i'd be willing to put into it i was wondering if you would come down to $3000",Hey. Thank you for your interest in the Blazer. The only work that really needs to be done is having the power steering pump replaced-which I will be providing with the vehicle. Its a simple job and does not require much effort. A mechanic won't overcharge you for it either.
"i get that, but with the body work only mostly done i would be taking over the project of finishing it. i would also be willing to come pick it up from you if that helps.",How does $3150 sound to you ?
Hello. I just saw your ad and am interested in it. Can you tell me if everything is in working order?,"Yes it is in working order.  It has had a few modifications as well.  It has been lowered 2"", and has a turbo 400 with a shift kit transmission."
"Okay, that works for me. If I've got all cash would it be possible to come down a little on the price?",$5750
"Wow, you have it listed at 5000, right?","Sorry, typo.  $4750 is my lowest."
"I've got 4600 all in cold, hard cash. That's all I've got for this month. Wouldn't be able to go any higher than that. Budget is in place. Is that at all possible?",Yes I think that could work.
Hi,Hi

Does it come with a charger.,"Yes, it comes with a cable and an Ac wall adapter."
I am on a budget. Anyway you can come down in the price?,"Maybe. a little, i can do 260. And I will throw in a warranty"
I was hoping for more like $160.,It is in almost new condition. It is in great shape. How about if I deliver it to you?
"I could do 220, tops.",How about we meet in the middle? 240?
"Hi, interested in the motor.",Thanks. I'm listing it for $138
"Ya I saw that, any wiggle room on that price?","As you know, it will be delivered speedily but I'm willing to take $130"
I was hoping to pay more like $85.,Oh no! You might want to come up to $125
"Hmm, pretty high for me still.. any thing I could do to lower that price, say pick it up?",I can take off $10 if you pick it up
ok,Deal!
so 115?,Yes. 115. Thanks for your patronage!
yes in buying the bike is it used,"Yes, slightly.  It is in excellent condition and has never been down."

thatss a deal geat offer,yes it is.  you want it?
yes,You can pick it up at the central park gazebo at 5:30
Hi there! I'm interested in the house you're selling.,"Hi there, good to hear.  I'm guessing you've seen the ad online and have seen all the features and the listing price?"
Hello!,Are you interested in buying this Bike?
Good day.  I saw your ad for a home to rent.,"Hello, I am asking 3700 per month on a one year lease"
"It's definitely an attractive place, but it's one of several I'm looking at.  I've seen similar ads priced as low at $1500.","That may be, but this house has 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a 2 car garage. It also comes with a washer/dryer/dishwasher/stove and oven, and has a large patio and backyard. The yard is also mowed and maintained by my associate, so you never have to worry about doing yard work"
"Ooh, I like the sound of that.  Yard work is a pain.  How about $2000, and I'll sign a 2 year lease.  Anything more than that is really out of my price range.","That is a little low, I have many people that are interested in the rental. But if you are willing to sign a 2 year lease, I can do $3200 per month"
"I'm neat, don't throw wild parties, non-smoker, and no pets.  I might be able to swing 2300, but that's as high as I can go.","You sound like you would make a great tenant. I can meet you in the middle at $2800, but I honestly can't go any higher"
"Can you do $2600?  As it is, I'm going to be eating ramen for a while.","I can $2600 on a 2 year lease, as long as you agree not to have any pets and keep the rental in excellent condition."
Deal!  Make it a 3 three lease-- I plan on staying in the area for a while.,Sounds good!
Is the price negotiable for this phone?,a little bit.  I can accept $125
How noticeable is the lifted screen?,it's hardly noticeable.
"Well, I would have to have it fixed so I don't think I will pay over $100 for it. Would you come down to $60?",No way!!!  I could come down to $115.  The phone works great!
Are there any accessories that come with the phone?,"The phone case, charger, and I can give you new ear buds."
Hello I'm interested in your 1970 Corvette Stingray Convertible and was wondering what kind of condition the car is in and how many miles it has on it.,"Car is almost new just needs a little bit of love. Like new dash as it has been sitting outside in the sun. The car has 97,165 miles"
Is the car under warranty?,i will give you a personal 90 day warranty. The manufacturers warranty ran out in 1975
"Can you throw in anything with the car like a spare tire, jack, jumper cables?","Spare tire, Jack, lug wrench trunk even includes a emergency roadside bag with jumper cable flares and rescue blanket"
How much are you asking for all of this?,Originally i was going by the kelly blue book price of 24000 but i am willing to let it go for 22000
"I'm ready to make you an offer of $17,500 and pay you cash today.","I cant i have to much invested I had a offer for $19,000 this morning. He is supposed to come by in the morning but it is a first come first served"

Hello.,"Hey there, let me sell you on our $100 plan.  Unlimited minutes, text and data."
I see that you are offering  Metro FLASH on my phone.,"Yes, are you interesterd in the $100 unlimited plan?"
"No, I have an extremely limited budget, is there something more affordable?","We have a $70 plan with only 2GB of data, or a $50 plan with 1GB data.  The $100 plan you get a free iPhone"
I don't need a new phone and I don't have a smart phone. Do you do anything without data?,"Yes the $40 plan which has no data, does that sound good?"
Still too expensive for me.  How about a pre-pay option? or pay as you go?,Pay as you go is $30 per month and +$.05 for any minute over 120
What I really need is just an emergency phone. Something that I can use for emergencies only. do you have anything like that?,What are you looking to spend?
"I'd love to keep it around $10-15 if I can, My budget is one where I can't afford a lot of extras.","I can offer you a $15 phone that allows only 5 calls per month. 30 minutes only, and +.25 cents for minute over"
Is the price the same if I bring my own phone?,"Yes, there's not a carrier in the entrie world that will offer you a $15 plan."
I'm interested in the drawer. How about $45 and I will pick it up myself?,"Well the $70 price didn't include delivery, that's an extra $30.  I am willing to drop the price down to $55 for you."
How about 53? You don't even have to clean it up before I go get it.  I will take it as is.,If you are willing to pick it up and clean it up and you bring cash I will accept $53
I can if you drop the price to 210,"You will pay cash, right?"
Of course,"Great. I will not assemble the set at all, and will only give you the set as-is, with the backing and glass door separately, and you will assemble it yourself. And we will call it a deal at 210 dollars."
Hello I'm interested in your bike. Is it all in working order?,Yes! It is in excellent original condition my friend!
"Super, that's great. I'm on a really tight budget and need this to get to work. Is there any way you could go lower, around 175? I could give you all cash today, pick it up myself, if you are available.","$175.00 is pretty low! I am trying to get a plane ticket to California my Dad just passed away, and I really need the money as low as I am willing to go right now is about $300.00 which will cover my cost. I can also drop this baby off for ya no extra charge."

The dimensions are a little off from what I need, but it is a pretty good deal, and fits what I need. I was hoping you could come a little bit off the price and deal it to me for around $230. Does that sound good?","it's a great table and the quality you can't find it in IKEA nor Pottery barn, I am willing to let it go for 240, is that fair enough"
"How about I come pick it up personally, and save you a few dollars to bring that price down to $230. I agree that I definitely couldn't find it in a local store, but I may have to do a bit of work on it once I have it.","ok I think I could do 230 if you are willing to pick it up then, we agree on 230"

That's still out of my budget. I could go as high as $1.200 and it does seem like the perfect bike. I'd hate to miss out.,That's still a little low. I've got a cover for it so you can keep it outside all year round. I'll throw that in. How about $1350?
"I could do 1,300, but that's already a month over overtime for me!",You sound like a hard worker. $1325 and we've got a deal.
Hi,"Hello, are you interested in my project?"
I am. How many times have you used it? Any issues while using?,"Sorry I meant to say product. I have used it just a couple times, and have had no issues."
I read some bad reviews about it that the cable break fast. I am willing to risk and offer you $40 for it.,"I have confidence in this product, and think it is worth closer to $50."
I will come get it today if you will accept $45,Deal.
Hello!,Hi
"I saw your listing for the track bike, there wasn't too much detail, but how does it ride overall? I'm looking for something reliable.",It rides great. It's in excellent shape and you really can't do any better in terms of reliability than a Canondale
"Sounds great, I was hoping to shave a bit of cash off the price, would you be willing to go down to around $420?","That's a bit low from what I was looking to get. If you're willing to pick it up to save me the hassle of shipping, I could let it go for $525"
"Thats pretty fair, I could definitely pull the trigger on that if you dropped it down to $500. The location is a bit far out, but I wouldn't mind making the trip.","Ok, I think $500 is a fair price."
"Hi, im interested in reting the apartment. I am ready to offer $1100 right away cash.",That offer is too low. The apartment is located in a high brow area and its very cozy. It is going for that lower price because there is no parking available. Please try to negotiate with a much better price
Ok how about if I add $250 more to my offer,That will be $1350. This is still low considering that the apartment is well furnished with state of the art furnishing. Nevertheless i can leave it at $1800 for you
I couldnt afford that! The most I can pay is $1550 and I would be streching my budget a lot. I know its a lot to ask but I dont want to offer a price I cant afford.,Wow. If that is the case lets just leave the deal at $1600. If agreed you can start your application online right away on the stated web address.
"Hi, is there anyway you'd take 25 dollars for the bike?","Yes, I'll take 25"
This is a beautiful home for only 5395,It is. Great neighborhood too
It is the best. so for 5395 you are getting the best,I know that is why I bought it
"Hi, are you interested in my racing bike? I am selling for $200","No, but are you intersted in the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge that I am selling for $300?"

Okay sure. Will you be able to deliver it to me?,Sure I can do that
Cool.  I was looking for a bunkbed set.  So what is it made of?  And how old is it?,"It's made of pure walnut wood, only a couple of years old. The kids wanted separate beds now they fight too much."
I can understand that.  So what is the least you'll accept for it?,I'd say I can knock $15 off if you can pick it up.
I don't really need mattresses so if I pick it up how about $145?,If you pay 200 for the frame you get the mattress free.
how about 185?,185 is fine. But you have to take the mattress.
Hello I am interested in your unit. Can you tell me a bit more about the location,"Yes my two bedroom also have a one and a half bath with a garage and backyard. It includes a stove, refrigerator, dishwasher and garbage disposal. Laundry on site also"

Hello. I'm interested in building the truck. How many miles are on it?,"It doesn't have a lot of miles on it, maybe 25,000. I mostly used it for off road and hauling."

Is there anything wrong with the bike?,"No, a little old lady drove it to church on sundays,  It's mint!"

Hello I am really interested in this product,That's great. I'm interested in selling it to you.
How old is it?,"The iphone 5 was first released in 2012, but I guess I don't remember when I bought it? It's almost like I would have remembered if I had thought to write it down in the product description. Oh well."
"Thank you for the information. However, the price is too high for me. can we work on it?","Yes, I suppose we can negotiate. Let's negotiate, that's what I always say."
I can pay about $82 for it,"Well, that's a pretty attractive offer. Now we just need to decide where to do the deal. Would you like to meet up in a Tmobile store or would you rather meet up at a gas station?"
Gas station works really well for me. Thanks for the options. When can we do that?,"Well, I always think it's best to wait until it's really dark and spooky to meet up at a gas station, maybe we can meet up at midnight, exchange the phone and just see where the night takes us from there. Maybe get some slurpees from the gas station?"
Okay I think we're done with the deal and will meet up tomorrow then! Thanks,"Great, looking forward to meeting you in a gas station."

"$185 is a little high for me-- I can probably do $115, and I can even come pick it up to save you on shipping it.",How about 125. I'm afraid I can't go lower than that
That's fair.  I'll take it.,great. Thank you!
Hi! I just found your post about this iphone!,"Oh, great!  I take it you're interested?  It's a great phone."

"Well, can you tell me if there are any problems with the car?","No problems, I did recently replace the fuel pump and the rotary sensor, as well as the brakes and rotors"
"Well, then I'm interested. I'd like to pay $2750.","I could possibly work something out, but I don't think I can come down that low.  The tires are almost brand new too so you won't need to replace those for a while.  Will you be paying in cash?"
"Yes, I don't have any problem paying in cash.","Ok great, I could let you have the car for $4000 cash"

"I have no doubt that the car is in pretty good condition, but due to its age I don't think it would be wise to spend too much. I was hoping I could go for around $4,000","That will be a problem I put in the writeup that I still owe money on the car so we will have to do it at Wells Fargo and I owe 5200 and was hoping to make a little the difference between 5200 and my asking price of 7500 is 2300 so what kind of fair offer could you make me there?  Remember,  I may not be able to accept this offer if it is too low."
Hello I can give you 237 for it,I'm not sure I can take $237.  The asking price is $395.  I'd be willing to go down to $330

OK.  I could offer you $50 for it and I could pick it up today with cash.,"Well, that's a bit too low, as a new cover and charger would cost 30 or 40. But, I will take 60."
I could do $55 today- all cash.,"Okay, I can do that. Sounds good."
Hello?,Hi! I'm selling this for just 110
"I think I want to buy it, but I need a lower price",How much lower?

What is the lowest you'll take?,The lowest I would consider is $16000.
"That's way more than I wanted to pay.  It's almost 10 years old. While it's a great car, I wouldn't pay more than $12,500.","I can go down to $15000.  But, that is way lower than what I was willing to do originally."
"How about we settle at $14,000.  You'll have cash in hand and I'll have a new car.",$14500 and you have a deal.
I am interested in these speakers I am concerned about their fuctionability. Is the price negotiable?,"As far as I know, they still work. You are welcome to come test it. I am open to any reasonable offer. They are really nice vintage pieces, though."
"Yes, it looks like something I would be interested in for the right price.",I'm asking $900 but am willing to make a deal with a serious buyer.
My husband and I are interested.  I could do $450 cash today and we could pick it up.,"That's a little less than what I was willing to go , even for a pick-up. I can go at least $625."
Would you be able to do $600?,"Well, i need to get it out to make space for my new bedset. So yes, I'll do $600 and you will still pick up?"

"Well I would love to become a tenant. I see you have 200 dollars off right now, but I don't need the granite counter tops.

But with all of our outstanding features, I would love to see you living in this apartment for $2900 a month. We have massive soaking tubs, water saving showerheads, and highspeed internet that will keep those precious kidOs happy all day!"

I am willing to pay 1400,Agreed
Hi! Beautiful car..,Thank you it is all original and has an 8 foot long bed. Great deal.
Is it still working great?,It starts but beyond that I cant tell you much about the engine. It is a 1959 model. The exterior body has no rot
So maybe it needs a little fix. can you go down to $13000?,"With the body being in the condition it is and this is a 59 model, I would feel better at 14000"
yes but I still need some room to fix the car. Will you accept $13500 cash?,Yes that sounds great.
nice dresser. looks pretty antique,"thank you, it is I hate to part with it but am moving to a smaller place"
i see. i'll tell you what. if you let me have it for 200 i'll coem and pick it up. you don't even have to lift a finger.,I am sorry that is a lot less then what I can let it go for.  I can do 375 and deliver it to you

"Hello, I'",Hi
"I'm interested in your listing, what condition is the phone in?",It is in prestine condition.
How well does it work for games like Pokemon Go?,I think you would be able to capture them to your heart's desire.
"Oh, cool. I'm interested in buying, but $70 is just slightly too much for me, how about $60?",I think I could do 60 if you can pick it up..
"Hi, is the phone still available?","Hello, it sure is. I have a few people interested though."
How long have you had it?,"I have had it for about 5 months. It is in like new condition, all accessories come in the box."
That sounds great. Would you consider coming down in price at all?,It does retail for over $500. I can come down to about $300 but buy has to pick up or pay shipping.
I'd like to offer 190 plus a $25 Starbucks gift card,Would you be able to do $280 plus $25 gc and pick up? I really want this gone today and as I said a few people are interested and willing to get it today.
Alright how about 265 and the gift card. I'll pick it up today,I can do that!
Hello,I see you've found this awesome bike of mine!
"Yeah, who knew you could actually find anything good on craigslist...",Absolutely. I haven't had the bike for long. I was out of the Mountain biking game for a while but decided to get back in the game. So I picked this bad boy up. I loved it but now it's time to move on. How does $1350 sound?
I like that it is not very old but at the same time there is no way to know how well it was maintained over that time or what kind of trails you took it on. For a used bike I'm afraid that is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to come down on the price at all if I were to come pick it up right away and pay cash?,"It's in great condition, I can assure you, but I understand you worries. I could drop down to $1100"
That is a fair price. I could do that.,Glad to hear it!
"Hi! Yes, I've been looking for one.",It's a cool phone with lots of storage. It has me Dr been activated.
"Hello, I am interested in your Samsung Galaxies!","Hi! I have 6 Samsung Galaxy S8s listed, how many are you interested in?"
"I am interested in all 6! However, $650 is a little high for me. I was thinking $550 would be fair","Hmm, they are brand new devices though. Still in the box with the original wrapping. They have never been used before and they are Samsung's latest model just released. I could do $600/each"
I am little bit worried about them exploding. I saw in the news that some of the Samsung phones exploded! I don't think I could risk losing that much money. Would you take $585 for them?,"Don't worry about them exploding! That was the Galaxy Note series, and Samsung has taken extreme measures to prevent that from happening again. But yes, I'll take $585!"
Hi I'm interested in buying your storage unit,"Yeah sure, it's in great condition as you see, it looks basically brand new. There's a lot of space. I'm pretty firm on the $25 as this was much more new, anything else you'd like to know?"
Is it metal or plastic?,It has metal parts but the drawers are plastic.
Hmmm...since it's used and basically plastic I'd be afraid it would crack or break easily.  Would you be willing to accept $12?,You couldn't find something like this for that cheap. How about $20 and you come pick it up?
15?,"Sure, we can do $15."
Hello I am interested in your toyota. Can you tell me more about it? Color? Miles? wear and tear?,"The color is white (officially ""Super White""), it has 79,000 miles on it, and it's in good condition. I'm looking to sell it for $36,000."
Are you the original owner?,"Yes, I am. Do you have an offer on the price? I'm willing to negotiate a bit."
I am willing to offer 32000,I can accept that price if you can pay for it within the next 48 hours.
Good morning,I see you're interested in the apartment I have for rent. Do you agree with the rental fee?
It is a little small for that price.,yes that is acceptable. you are right. it is high above median rent for the area.
"Yes, does the bike have any damage to it?","Nah, it's in perfect condition. It'd cost you 200 for this at the store. I can bring the price down to 160 if you want"
If I pay in cash and pick it up today could you do $102?,"I mean we've already received an offer from someone else for 135, do you want the bike?"
"Hi, I'd like to know what condition the tables are in.","of course, They are in excellent condition, no scratches or marks"
Is there a wobble to them? Is there anything underneath the tables?,they have rubber feet on the ends /bottom. no wobble very stable and great condition .
Wow love the Couch. SO lovely and it appears to really be in a good condition. May i know why you want to sell it?,It is in great condition but we have changed the decor in the living room and it doesn't really fit with the new style.
Oh i see. Can i have for $700,Um...no... The price in the listing should say $1495. It is microfiber which holds up very well.
Oh i see. I can step up to $1000 cash payment. Logistics will be arranged by me. Deal?,"Like I said the couch is in good condition, has quality material and is a sectional with many pieces."
Not a priority for me but will love to have it and my budget is $1000. I can add $100 more. That is the best i can offer Deal?,"Sorry, negotiating does not mean just continuing to spam lower numbers. I would like to work with you but you haven't really given me any reason to lower the price. Sorry."
Yes I am,It's a great apartment in a wonderful community. What are you willing to offer?
I'm willing to offer 1520,"How about 1900? It's a  quiet community, and there's a pool in the development!"
"I absolutely love the description, however, I have received much lower prices for the same amenities",The lowest I can go is $1800. Any less than that and I'll be losing money. Would that work for you?
"Let's meet in the middle, 1700",1750?
1725,"Okay, deal"
Yes. Is it in good condition?,Yes very good condition. Only 4 years old lightly used. I got it from Ikea. Has a machine washable cover so it's perfect if you have pets. I'm asking $150 and I'm pretty firm on that.
"Okay. I really would like to purchase it, but since it is four years old I was thinking more around 130. If it helps, I can come get it today.","Yea, that's a fair price. Deal."
Hello! I have been searching for this Pioneer Cd player and finally have come across one!,"Hello, well, today is your lucky day. It's yours for $50"
This feels like my lucky day for sure only problem is that I do not have $50,"I understand that, I'm strapped for cash myself and I need to pay for books for school."
I have $25 cash and my  old smart phone that I can offer you,"Yeah, I could do 35 and the smart phone."
yikes! i only have $30 cash plus the smart phone?,"Well, I suppose I could do that."
Yes I am! What's it's condition? Is it new and good quality?,"The condition is good just that they have some sort of discoloration because of sitting out in the sun, but apart from that everything else is great"
"Oh nice! I can stop by later today, probably in a few hours, with $7 cash, would that work for you?",okay that's fair! See you in the afternoon then I just wanna get rid of the chairs so I will settle with that!
Hello there.,"Hello, I have my trusted Jaguar that is for sale at the low price of $3500. It is a steal of a deal because it is in immaculate condition."
According to your description it's in good condition and is reliable.,Yes it certainly is you cannot go wrong with this vehicle
It's also 15 years old. What is the absolute lowest price you'll take for it.,Give me $3000 and she's yours.
I still think that's a bit too high. How close are you willing to come to $2200?,"Even though she is old she has modern updates. I put a lot in this car, not forgetting that she is a Jaguar. $2900 and you have a deal"
How about $2500? I don't know if these aftermarket parts or authentic Jaguar parts..,I don't use anything that is not in keeping with the Jaguar name. $2850 final offer.
Good and you?,Very well thanks! Are you interested in my offer? Any questions?
"I am! It sounds good but people don't sell vehicles unless something is wrong with them soooo.... what is it's dings, bumps, bruises, quirks?",Nope absolutely nothing wrong with it I am simply upgrading! You are welcome to schedule an appointment to get it checked or take it for a test drive.
That would be perfect! Would you take $2500 for it?,No nothing near that low for a car this nice it only has 60000 miles on it and is in beautiful condition.
It is almost 8 years old and only has 60000 miles??? Did you ever drive it? How about $3000,My commute is only 5 miles and no that is less tham half my offer.
Alright then half of your offer $3500,No i;m afraid you will have to look elsewhere the lowest I'll go is 6000.
This looks like just the thing I need! Will you be able to sell this right away?,"Yep, It's in great condition, we can get it shipped out to you very soon. We're looking for $40 for the entire thing including shipping.  The original price would be much higher, however we are having a moving sale!"
yes how many miles are on it I am not seeing that,only 20k miles on it. It's in excellent condition inside and outside. Maintained well with little use.
Wow I really want this but my budget is not quite there.  Do you have any room on the price?  I would be able to buy it today if I can get the price down,"I'm selling it to try and pay off student loans, so im afraid I can't go any lower than $15000, its in really good condition, it would be a steal even at $15000 so no way I can go lower."
hi i am interested in the apeaker,Glad to hear it!
can i get some details about it,Sure! Its in great condition! It lasts up to 10 hours on a single charge! The sound is very rich and there is the bass sounds great. Its also bluetooth. You can even use it as a speakerphone with your phone
that sounds great! how about the price?,I am currently asking $100 not including shipping!
how about 100 with shipping?,I think that sounds fair to me!
Hey there how much for your bike im interested in buying it for sure!,I would like $500 for it. It's a really great bike.
Yeah I see its got a lot of custom features on it. Any chance you could drop the price to $425? I was originally only trying to spend like $350 so this is a big jump in budget.,I'm asking so much because of the customization and because I have kept it up so well. I can come down to $475 to help you out a bit.
what color is the chair,It is brown
is it in good condition,"Yes it is new condition. I haven't taken it out of the box. So, it's never been used."
does it recline and can you take$60,"Yes, it does recline. Since it's new, I would like to get at least $80 for it."
i can do $65 and pick it up,"How about $75, I haven't even taken it out of the box."
ok that worou can drop it offks if y,I'm sorry can you resend the message. I didn't get it clearly.
ii will pay $75 if you can drop it off,"Okay, that work's with me."
"Yeah, I was looking at the apple router and had a few questions for you.","Oh okay, it supports multiple devices, and is from the latest generation for apple devices, what's up?"
Will it support a apple laptop?,"Oh definitely, both with wifi and cabled capabilities. I'll throw in the cables if you want, $65 and we're square?"
"Sounds like a good deal, How much has it been used?  Is there any scratches or damage to it?","Nah, it's only seen about a few months use, we're moving and the wife wants me to go PC, so happy wife happy life I suppose :("
"Yep, that's what they say.. :)  ok $65 sounds good.",thanks for working with me
"Hi, I am interested in the bike","Awesome! It's in great condition and works perfectly for an adult plus a small kid. All 7 gears work well, its really nice paint job. I'm asking for $100 for it"

"Well, are there any problems with the bike?","Nothing at all, it's a great track bike and critical bike"
"So, why are you interested in selling the bicycle?",I am needin some extra money and I just bought a new bike last weekend
"Well, I suppose I could take the bike off your hands for $375.","I am needing at least 500 for it, it's basically brand new"

"Yes, I am. How old is the bike?",The bike is a very old Italian Bianchi. I don't have an exact year.
Understood. Does it ride great?,Absolutely! The bike has been completely rebuilt with a new set of wheels! I also replaced the chain and seat and relubricated the bike.
Thanks. Would you accept $84 for it?,I can't do $84. I have more invested in it than that after the rebuild. I can come down to $110.

i am interested.,Great! Do you want just one or multiple phones for an even better deal?

Is the bike still available?,Yes it is. It is in great condition and only needs to be cleaned a little.
how low would you go on the price?,If you could pick it up today and pay for it in cash I would be willing to drop the price to $80.
how about 70 and I will pick up in the next hour,"Okay, I can do that. You've got yourself a deal."
"Yes I like the bike but because the tires are huge white walls I will have to spend a ton of money on white wall cleaner, so would you take fifty dollars?","That is far below my asking price, I could not in good faith accept $50, I am sorry. I could perhaps go a bit lower, but $50 just will not cut it. A bike like this is worth spending on a tub or two of white wall cleaner."
How about $100 and you throw in a tub of white wall cleaner?,"$200, You come pick it up, Then Ill throw in my tub of cleaner."
"I like the way you think but how about this, and I can't do better. I'll pick up the bike and the white wall cleaner for $150 and two tickets for Spider-Man Homecoming.","$170, ill throw in the tickets, And I won't ruin it with spoilers when you show up at my door."

No cracks on the screen?,"No cracks and no dings.  It is completely flawless, almost as if you just took it out of the box."

"Ok, That sounds far",great when do you want to cpome check it out in person?
"Hey there, I am interested in your apartment.",Hello
The price is a little steep.  Would you take $1800 a month?,The price is in line with comparables in the area. A 2 bed/ 2 bath with all of these amenities is going to run you this much or more in this location.
How about I pay full price but you cover internet and trash and water?,Water is included and there is free wifi in the Business Center which extends to most units.
Can we do half on the deposit?,Deposit isn't negotiable. But what we could do is split the deposit and make the other half due the following month so you don't have to come up with such a large amount upfront.
Hi. I am really interested in your furniture. Do you have any pets or children?,No I do not have any pets or children
Do you mind telling me how many stains are on the furniture and where?,Sure. The stain is very light and it was caused when we tried to move in the furniture to the patio. Its very light and not seen at all. I mentioned it to make sure that when I sell the buyer has the knowledge of it.
How old is the furniture? 550 seems awful high. I saw something at goodwill for less than half of that price that was similar.,"Well the furniture is as new and its a branded one too and I am selling it for half the price of what I had got it for. So 550 is reasonable, but I am willing to negotiate. Give me a price!"
I was hoping you would be willing to go 250?,Wow that's way too low. That's half of what I am selling it off for. I can give it to you for $400
"Maybe 300? Money is awful tight and we just had a house fire, lost everything. And with the baby on the way, I just can't go much higher.",$380 is the last price I can help you with. I need to get my money to get my wife a new couch too so its just fair.
Okay. I think I may have to keep looking unless you will accept 350.,Well I can give it to you for 350 its not like 30 dollars is gonna take me anywhere :) Deal!

It has 4 extension leaves, custom glass cut to fit game table size.  It is a great table.  I'm asking $1000 but might be willing to negotiate."
Can you go lower to about 500 dollars? I am on a tight budget right now.,"I understand a tight budget, but you are getting a three in one beautiful all wood table.  If you are willing to pick it up I'll accept $750"
"I am willing to pick it up. But, I would like to pay 700 for it. Is that okay?",Well it's less than I'm asking but I'll accept $700 provided you pick it up tonight.
I will. Is it a deal?,Deal!
Hello.,Are you interested in this propert?
"I am, but the price is way above my budget. I'm a college student, and living on beans and rice. If you have an opening in your leasing office that would be idea if I could work for the complex and rent at a reduced rate. I was a leasing agent at my last apartement complex.  It had 150 units.","This one is a 1 bed 1 bath with some nice amenities that is more luxury than beans and rice unfortunately.  I can only go for  1900 lowest, as it even has its own soaking tub, private balcony, tall ceilings, and fireplace."
Could you do 1825?,I could accept that yes that is reasonable.
"hello, nice wheels. so you're interested in a trade also? I have a suv which i'm tryign to sell myself.",nice. what is your year and model for the SUV?
"it's a jeep wrangler 4 door. 2010, got about 60K on it. mostly highway miles. i've got it listed at 20K","I guess it wouldn't work for us. We are looking for a Land Rover. So if I throw in snow tires, will you consider the BMW for 14,900?"

"Ok, great. What colors are they and what condition? Does it come with the original packaging?",sorry colors are random. Yes its in original packaging. The 2 bands will be 2 different colors
"I understand. I'm willing to come and get them, and considering the fact that I can't pick out the colors, do you think we can negotiate on the pricing a bit?","Since you're coming here you can actually pick out your color, we can do $55 since you're paying for gas, its reasonable"
hello,Hi! How are you today?
I am good how about yourself?,Not too bad. I see you're looking at the vanity and dresser?
"Yes, i am. can you please tell me more details about the vanity and dresser?","Sure, I've had it for a while, it has four large drawers. Two are on the left side and two are on the right. The surface of the desk is light brown, the same color wood as the rest of it. Very heavy item but looks and works great in any room!"
ok. i see that you are asking $650. is that your final price? i can pay you $325 right not for them,It's not my final price but $325 is definitely too low for me to afford right now. I also knocked off $125 off the price already due to the nail polish spill. I am thinking more in the $575-600 range. How does that sound?
it is still on the high side. how about $490,You drive a hard bargain! How about we meet in the middle at $530 and I'll personally deliver the vanity. I own a truck and my son can come help me move it wherever you'd like!
Let's do $500.,Sounds good
Okay - here's my final offer.,Willing to deliver for full price

How many owners?,"My father was the owner, he never really used it and then gave it to me. Its in great condition and works perfectly"
What's the condition of the interior?,Its a full leather package. No scratches or marks
Sounds good will you accept  $38000 in cash?,Thats too low for a Porsche Carrera. Im in no rush to sell
"I see, how about $40000?",$49000 is the lowest I can go
Make it $45000 and you got a deal.,Ok $45000
"Good morning, I am interested in your car but would like to know if you have all of the service records on it.",That can be provided with the car.
Mainly interested in seeing the oil change and tune up service records from 2007 to present.,"We would be able to provide that, would you like to make an offer?"
oh yes but just one more question.  Have you ever driven it cross-country i.e. to another state?,"No, it was only used locally and for short trips to beach or mountains."
That's good!  I am looking to spend $13500,"That's very low for great condition of the car, which has been kept up to date with all maintenance. How about we meet in the middle. $15500?"
"I would not mind paying that much for this car, unfortunately I have to keep a budget so I cannot go too much over can you let me have it for $14500?",Deal.
Good afternoon. I'm interested in the table and chairs you have listed. Can you give me some information about these items?,"It is in amazing shape, very good quality wood. Its very heavy but we can help you move it if you want to buy it"
"It's definitely very close to what I've been looking for. However, money is very tight for me right now. I'm looking for something closer to $1500","Honestly, the lowest I can go is 2250.. I have it listed for 3000 and I feel its worth that."
"Oh, I have no doubt about the quality. Like I said, I'm just on a budget, and I have my eye on a few other table sets. However, I'm willing to buy yours today for $1800.","Ok, I can do ahead and do that. $1800 sounds good to me."
"I am, I understand the bike has a few paint chips, is it rusting?",No rust at all and its just a few minor paint chips.
Are the tires in good condition?,Great condition replaced them 500 miles ago.
Why are you selling it?,Its a great bike built like a tank and I'd keep it but sadly I need the cash more.
I'll pick it up tonight. I can give you $650 cash.,I can't go that low. How about $775
$725 and you have a deal,How about I meet you in the middle. $750?
$740?,$740 you have a deal my friend.
"HOI,give me a moment, reading description",Okay let me know if you have any questions..
Is this item brand new in box?,"Yes it is brand new, sealed in retail box still :)"
"It sounds good, although I do believe the models with rechargeable batteries are superior. Coin batteries are often expensive and difficult to find. Will you accept $25? I can pick up immediately.",Actually the coin batteries allow this to have a smaller size so it's very compact. It's worth 35. I can maybe lower it to 30 if that helps you out.
30 is acceptable to me. Thank you.,Okay got a deal :)
Hello. I came across your ad of this lovely little 1BR apartment. Is it still available?,it is and I'm asking  $1750
"Yes, I see that. I had a few questions though.",Ok
Is there a gym on site? Does the complex have a swimming pool and what about laundry facilities? Is it gated?,There is no gym but a local track is just a block away.
"I see your asking price, do you have a pick-up that would enable you to get the to my home?",I do. I can offer to bring anywhere within the Hayward/Castro Valley area or along 580/13 corridor if needed. Where are you located?
I am located in Hayward.  I will pay the $150 if you bring them too me.,I'm happy to do that. I'm available any day this week to pack them up securely and bring to your location. Do we have a deal?
We do.  How about tomorrow morning?,Sounds great. Please send me your address. Does 10:30am sound okay to you?
I'm interested in buying the bike. Do the small cracks make the bike unusable?,"Awesome! nope the bike is perfect in function, the cracks are purely aesthetic and only affect the look of the frame not its function or structural integrity. I'm asking for $150 for it"
I can't pay that much for the bike. Would you accept $74?,"I can go down to $100, which is a reasonable price for a bike of this quality. I can deliver it to your place free of charge as well. What do you say? Do we have a deal my friend?"
"Hello, I am interested in your bike. What condition is it in?",It is in excellent condition. Only used for 50 miles.
Good evening! I'm very impressed with your offer of the home in Pittsburg. Could you tell me if it's close to any grocery store or schools?,"You will have your pick of markets to choose from as you can walk to many. Well within walking distance of daily farmer's markets and food festivals. The elementary and middle schools are also within walking distance, but the high school requires transportation."
That shouldn't be an issue as my son has his license. What types of restaurants are near?,Local favorites such as Primanti Bros. and Peppi's offering sandwiches along with meals. Plenty of seafood choices as well.
That's great. I'm excited about the large master and oversized shower. Are you willing to lower the price a little?,"My favorite parts of the house. Sure. How about $2,000?"
"I was thinking closer to $1,200. I'll have to bring my own washer and dryer to hook up and the fridge isn't included.","That's just in the photos. We recently got a new one. Would be willing to do $1,900 and leave the furniture. Already have an offer for $1,800 as is."
"But the description says that even though the fridge is in the photos, it's not included. Are you saying there is a fridge now?","Sorry, read that wrong. There is no fridge."
"Okay. Are you willing to put a fridge in or do I need to bring one? that will cost around $500. I'm willing to do $1,300","I would be willing, but not for $1,300. The lowest I could go is 1,850 with no furniture left behind."
"$1,600 is as high as I am willing to go. I don't need furniture, and it's only 3 bedrooms, plus I'll need to cover utilities","Sorry, already have an offer for $1,800. That's my final offer."
Hello there.. i was looking for some more info on the truck you have for sale please,Sure I can give you any info you like. For starts it was well taken care of and we have never really had any major problems with it. It also recently had new tires put on. What else would you like to know?
Has it got any dings been in any accidents?,"Never been in any accidents and it has no dents, dings or scratches."
No rust?,"none, it is in great condition."
Would you take $4800 for it?,$4800 is too low for me. It is pretty low miles for a great work truck like this. I can go down to $6000.
hmm thats still a little much for me how about we meet in the middle and $5500,As long as you can meet me at my place then $5500 is acceptable to me.
Yes I am. Can you tell me a little more about them? Is there any wear and tear?,"It's in really pristine condition, we barely ever used it, so no major scratches or chips."
"That is great. We just moved into a larger apartment and need a new dining set. I would like to offer you $60 for them. That is cash in hand, and I will bring my truck and pick them up today.","That sounds like a pretty good deal, but I'm wondering if you could go any higher? Maybe $70 and I'll help you load truck?"
That sounds really fair to me. Sounds like you have a deal.,"Ok, see you later today!"
"hi, that seems slightly higher than what i expect from the pictures",What do you think is a fair offer?
i think $1000 is a fair deal,That works. I can accept that amount.
What can you tell me about the Trek you have for sale?,"it's a great bike, but needs a little work.  It needs new tires, seat, and brakes"
I see that.  Why have you decided to sell it?,I got a new bike crom my wife for my birthday
"Lucky you!  Treks are nice bikes: I hope you got another.  I'm willing to pay $60, and I can pick it up today.",$70 and you have a deal
Hello!,Hello there! Thanks for viewing the listing. Are there any questions I can answer for you about the bike?
"Hello, I understand you are interested in the house.",Yes i am renting out my town house
"I am interested in renting it, what is the least you would take","well I am asking $2200 but am willing to negotiate somewhat. the house is on a quiet street, very spacious, has all stainless steel appliances. youi will not be disappointed"
I could pay 800 a month or what can we work out.,that is much too low I would take more like 1900 a month. just look at this place its worth a lot more
I would only be able to pay a max of 1100 a month,If you can pay $1600 then I would be willing to take that but if you rent the following year I would have to increase the rent to $1800
how about 1600 for a 3 year rental contract.,I will take that but no smoking or pets allowed
Hello,"Hello, I'm trying to sell my bike for $60."
It looks nice. Is it in good condition?,"The frame is perfect, but other parts would need to be replaced, like the tires and the front. Honestly, this bike is ideal for either decoration or to be broken down with."
Can I get you to cut the price in half? I would like to pay 30 dollars for it.,"Half would be a little too low for me, but I could do $35."
35 and how about I pick it up myself? I can come by tomorrow around 1 pm,Yeah that sounds good!
yes i am what is the lowest you can offer it at if i pick it up and pay with cash,"Do you have anything to trade? If you have a old mens wind up, automatic, kenetic, solar, or eco drive watch I would do a trade. Or even a smart phone?"
yes i have a nice smartphone im looking to trade if you can bring the price to 35 collars,That would be great. If you are willing to trade the phone I would definitely be willing to do 35 dollars.
Hello there!,Are you interested in one of our luxurious apartments?
"Hi, can you tell me more about the condition of the iPhones?","Both are like new.  My parents who are retired used them for about 6-7, with less than 10 hours of talk time."
"What does it mean they used them ""for about 6-7""?","oops!  sorry, it's late and I'm trying hard to get these phones sold.  I meant to say they used them for about 6-7 months."
"Ok. Well, I think that those phones probably got a good amount of use in 6-7 months. So, would you be willing to accept a price of $75?","No, my parents are both retired and basically used them to call me as I'm an only child and their calls were not that often.  I need to get at least 95 for each phone."
"Can you give me free delivery? I'd be willing to do that and pay $95 for each phone, if you can throw in the free delivery. The product is in good shape, after all.",I think we can do that since you're local.  190 for both phones and I will deliver.  How's tomorrow afternoon?
sounds good,Great!  I hope you enjoy your new phones.
Hi. I am interested in the bunk beds.,"These bunk beds are great with free mattresses, no pillows and sheets, excellent condition."
"I'm not in need of the mattresses, and I was wondering if we could work on a deal that we can both agree on? $290 is just way out of my range.",If you pick it up and cash only I could drop it to $185 lowest as I am moving. It would help me as well.
How about $155 and I can come pick it up right now?,"That is too low for me, $185 is the best I can do."
Love those wheels. How old are they?,"Hi, they are from the eighties, were on my son's bike"
"How much? I am kind of poor, hence MT.","Well, i need to get rid of them, I was asking 80 but would take 40 for them."
Could I buy just one? Bozo just needs one for his unicycle. His career is dependent upon the wheel. He does not have SS.,Well I really wanted to sell the pair. Do you have a bike to trade? I would take that or if it was just one it would be 25.
Bozo could come over and entertain you...,"Haha, I am scared of clowns but my grandkids might like it, how about 15 for one wheel."
hi,"Hello , there!"
hi this is a nice bed all i have is $133,That's fine!
ok when can i pick it up,"You can stop by anytime today. I can hold it for you till Tuesday of next week, at the latest."

Great the price is pretty high. Would you be willing to accept $840 I will pick it up myself and pay today?,"Yes, I can accept that offer."
"Hi, I should say right away that I'm on a strict budget","Okay, Let's see what we can do for you. How many bedrooms do you need?"
Awesome! I only need 2,"Great, I could do a 2 Bedroom w/ all the amazing amenities for $1,500."
Dang..I am forced to move away from my old place because I can't afford it at 1325...I was hoping to pay something more like 800-1000.  Is that at all possible?,"$1,000 is a bit low, If you could make a one bedroom work I could do $1,200 w/ one month free"
HI is the still available or taken?,"Yes, the unit is still available."
Is the location around main shopping areas?,"Well, you're right by downtown, so you can find everything you need within a short drive."
That's true. I am very much interested but the price is way way high for me. Is that something we can work on?,"Well, I have a little bit of room to negotiate, but this is already a huge steal at only $2400 a month."
I can afford $1680? I mean I could do some volunteering work if that helps to make up for the price?,"Well, If you can come up to $1900, I think we'd have a deal."

"I am good, I am homeless with around 800 in cash and am very interested in this home.",I am asking 1595 a month for this house and also a security deposit equal to one months rent which could vary based on credit.
Oh wow that sounds like such a good deal. I hope we can reach a compromise so I can not live in a box forever.,That would be great.  I am sure that there is something we can work out.
1000 then? I can get Bill next door to lend me 200 so I can meet you closer to your list price.,The best that I can do is 1200 if you would be willing to sign a 2 year lease.  Would that work for you?

"Hello, I am interested in buying your property.",Actually it is for rent. Is that something that you are interested in?
"Yes it is, is it good for a large family.","Oh yes it is 4 bedrooms 3 bathrooms, almost 2000 sqft.  How many are in your family?"
"Seven people, but we are used to sharing bedrooms. Sorry in my last message I just meant to say yes, ""is it good for a large family?"",sorry for the typo.",Not a problem.  So the price is 4300 with a security deposit that is dependent on your credit.  When would you like to come take a look?
"Anytime is fine, but $4300 is way out of my budget, can we go down to 2100?","There is no way that I can go that low.  Keep in mind that this price does include all utilities at an amazing property.  It really is a resort style property with an amazing pool as well as a bbq area that is just amazing.  This condo was just completely remodeled, we are actually putting the finishing touches on it right now.  The lowest that I would even be willing to consider would be 4100 a month."
Could you go 3900?,You drive a hard bargain but I think I can take 3900.
Hey do you still have the night stand?,"Hi! Yes, I do. Would you like to buy it for $10?"

Hello I'm very interested in purchasing your Galaxy S8,"It is a beautiful phone.  I stupidly purchased it for a former lover, but you know what they say, nothing is permanent. I paid $900, so this is a huge loss."
I have about $675 cash  that I'm willing to offer. Can I also add my current phone with the $675 cash? If you sell my phone you'll make enough for what you're asking. I can also drive to you and save you on gas money!,Wow! Wha is your current phone. I think this is a definite possibility so long as there are no cracks in the screen and it has a clean esn.
"It's a galaxy S7. I have it paid off so you can jailbreak it to whatever carrier you need. I am the only owner of this phone, I can meet you at a Tmobile carrier to verify that.","Sounds like a plan. I accept that offer,"
Yeah they look nice. How much do you want for them,"Right now I'm looking for around $40, but I'm willing to negotiate if you'd like"
Yeah $40 is more than I can go. I can do $20 right now,I'm not sure if $20 is what I'd want. These glasses are still in great condition. How about $30?
I think that $25 would be better. Lets say $25 and call this done. What do you think?,Deal.
"Hi, I am interested in your home for sale. Do you have any pets or children?",It' actually not for sale. I am renting out the upstairs.
"Yea, sorry I misspelled that, my wife and I are interested in renting a room. The asking price of $2800 is way above what I'm willing to spend. I could rent an entire house to myself for that. Would you consider $1900?","I can't go down that low, since there will be two of you. Did I mention that Utilities are included?"
No you did not so that is a plus. How about $2400. I have amazing credit and always pay my rent on time. I can provide a credit score check to prove it.,Perfect!
Hello I am looking into buying a new case...,I have this one still available.
Can you tell me what kind of condition it is in... is it a new case or a used case...,It is brand new still in the box.
"Excellent. Can you tell me, does it come with those screen protection sheets...",It has a durable wrapping that is a screen protector that resists scratching and fading.
"Well, the asking price is a bit out of my price range... would you consider going lower","Yes but not too low, what abotu $20?"
"Hmm, that still seems a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider 17","Alright, just because I am wanting to sell."
Hi there,"I'ts a great place to raise your kids, with the school minutes away."
"It ismy understanding it is arental/lease not to buy, is that cirrect?","Yes that's correct. We're asking for around $3500. The neighborhood is great. The house has a brick patio in the backyard, and the yard has a gardener, its very relaxing."
is it non smoking?,"Nope, you can smoke all you want. Id rather it be out on the patio, but on a rainy day I understand."
"That is actually an issue for me, my son is ashmatic and i am sensitive to the smells . Can you come down to 2400 to make this place worth while for us?","I'm sorry but that's not a problem, as nobody smokes in the house currently or in the past, so as long as you don't smoke it won't be a problem for your son. I was just letting you know that you are allowed to smoke if you please. The price I can drop down to is going to have to be 2900 at the bare minimum. I hope you understand, I have other clients coming in looking at the place and some have already tried to buy it for around $2600."
"Hi, I'm moving to the bay area is West Oakland a good neighborhood?",Where are you moving from?
Vegas,oh yea. You will live this place a lot more than Vegas. Nice weather. Nice views

So is the parkingon the street or is there a garage or parking lot? Where do you usually park?,I usually park right in front of the apartment. It's pretty easy to get in and out. You'll love it
Would you accept $1077?,That's a bit out of the range i'm looking for. i might be willing to come down to $1650 with first months utilities paid for
"Hi, says you've had it for 20 years. Do you know how many owners it has had all together? Do you know if it's been in any accidents?",I don't know all the owners. It hasn't had any accidents in the last 20. It is a great value.
You said it took the starter a bit to catch? Any other mechanical issues?,None that I know of. You might not need a new starter. You can have a mechanic check it out if you want.
"Would you be ok if I had one look at it tomorrow evening? I'm really interested I just want to know what I'm getting myself into. If it checks out I can offer you $20,250","Yes, tomorrow will be fine. I really need a little more than $20, 250. What about 21,500?"
For most of the other 2X2's in the bay area the s/f is larger. I'd like to offer $1680 for the unit.,That is a little bit too little. The apartment is cable ready and is very close to public transportation!
This is true and you cover the base utilities. Could you see $1750 perchance?,I could! If you would be able to put down a security deposit of a minimum of $1000 I would be willing to rent this out to you!
I think that would be a agreeable deal. Lets make this possible.,Ok sounds good! I will make an offer now!
Hi.  Can you unlock my apple phone?,"Yes, I sure can. My price is $50 a phone, including apples."
Would you accept $25?  I think this is the average price for phone unlocking.,"If it were the average price, I'd be out of business, I cant really negotiate."
Hi.  can you unlock my iphone?,I sure can. My price is $50 a phone.
"$25 is my budget for this, but what are the perks for $50?","I really cant do much for $25, But if you'd like, I can include a new case for it as well."
That would be perfect.  I need a new case.,Good deal.
REALLY? how fast is it?,120k miles
that is high mileage. How fast does it go?,"3000 mph i think im not sure ,it has a new flywheel so it might be faster thatn i think but i didnt test it out. its a prize"
"I think it's really ugly, but I want something to donate to the homeless shelter, and this may be it.","ok yea 8900 is a steal, they go for 30k brand new"
Hello,Hello
It seems like a great shelf unit. If I were to come pick it up would you take $30 for it?,This shelf took some effort to put together since it's very solid. Can you give me a better offer?
"I'm sorry, right now I'm in school and have limited funds. That's the best I can do.",How about 35 and I can help load it for you. Again it's already put together and you won't get a solid piece like that from a store already put together.
How many hours have you used this for?,Probably 24.  It's just too big for my small wrist so that's why I'm selling it.
can you ship it to me,I can ship it to you if you pay what I'm asking for it.  $150
it sells list price for 150. I could just get it on amazon with free shipping for that price brand new,Well???
"well if you aren't willing to sell it less than list price for a used watch, then I don't think we can come to an agreement","I wouldn't call 24 hours used, but if you want to forego the agreement that's okay."
I mean you need to get rid of the watch as it's currently useless to you. I'm willing to give you 130,I have to pay for shipping which I would naturally insure it for it's value so I'm firm on $150
You will never be able to sell it at the same price of a brand new watch. $138 is my final offer,"I'll accept $143, again I have to pay for shipping."
Hello I am interested in the vacation timer you have listed.  How many lamps can be hooked up to it?,"Hello, let me check on that for you"

"Okay I really would like one of these before my upcoming vacation, can we make a deal at $2?",$3 and we've got a deal!
Deal!,Great thank you!!
Hello. I'm interested in the Honda. How many miles are on it?,"Currently the vechicle has 120,000 miles on it but it is very well maintained."
"Understood. Would you be willing to accept $5,220 for it?",I would prefer to get atleast $5500 for the car. The kelly blue value is $6000 and I don't want to loose too much money on the car.
"I don't fault you for that. Would $5,350 work for you?","Make it $5,400 and we have a deal."
"HI, I'm really interested in your kicker vr subs","Great.  I liked them but time to move on, ya know?"
Makes sense. I wonder if you would accept a slightly lower price?,"No, price is firm.  They are worth it.  I would be flexible on the 1000 watt rms amp I also have listed though"
"Naw, I just want the subs but I only have $150",Sorry
"I am, looks nice","It is very nice. I just had it serviced, so it is ready to go. Brand new tires. Just broke in with 32,000 miles on it."
"Hello, I'm interested in the media cabinet",Perfect! Do you have any questions about the Cabinet?
just would like to know if it has any dings or scratches?,"It is in great condition, and does not have any damages! Would you like to purchase this fine piece of equipment!"
How about $10?,I will not go lower than $15 my friend.
I can go $15 if you are willing to deliver.,If was planning on having you come and pick it up 14 and you have a deal. As long as you come pick it up yourself!
"Hi, a studio apartment would be great for me right now. I am a responsible student with rental history looking to negotiate within my budget.",That sounds great.  What is your price range?
I'm looking to pay around 1288  but would be willing to sign an extra 6 months to lock in the price.,So you'd be willing to sign a lease for 1.5 years? Make it 2 years and I'll seriously consider the 1288
I would be finished with uni by then so that sound reasonable and I can hold off purchasing for 2 years. Sounds good to me.,Awesome.
Hi there. I'm interested in your phone.,Do you want to know anyhting more than what is included in the description? The cost is 120$
How is the screen any cracks?,"No scratches at all, everything works perfectly. Let me tell you also that the average price online for the same phone is more than 170$"
Is there a charger included?,"Yes, and I will add a pair of earbuds if you are interested. I'll give it to you for 110$ if you want it now."
Hi how are you doing?,"Great, I see you are interested in my Samsung TV"

"Oh awesome, if I was able to come by this afternoon with cash would you be willing to take 1100 for it?",I was think more $1200?
Yea I saw that is your listing price but I was hoping you would be willing to negotiate?,If you are really interested I can let it go for 1150
Hi. I am interested in your item. What condition is it in?,It's in great condition. Like new used very rarely.
Would you accept $10 and I will come pick it up myself right now?,$10 is really low for this item. this item clean and has no missing parts. You will get so much use out of it. How about $17 and you can pick it up
Can you meet today?,"Yes I can meet today. how about 2""00 pm?"
"Hi there, I'm very interested in the car but I'm afraid the price is abit too high for me",It's not that high. It's a custom car and I think the price is fair.
"Well I'm gonig to have to have it repainted as that color is terrible, so I""m going to eat some costs myself.",The cost of the paint job is not even included in the price I have it at. What is your offer?
29000,Let's do 31000 and I'll talk to my painter to give you a deal?
I like the look of it. Does it come furnished?,No it does not come furnished but it has a full kitchen and it is centrally located to everything. You would love living here. All utilities and internet are included too.
"Hello, I'm interested in your rental property.",Great it is 1595 a month with a security deposit equal to 1 month rent unless of course your have great or really damaged credit.
That sounds like a great deal but the best I can comfortable afford is $1350.,Well as I am just an agent for the owner I do not have all that much wiggle room but if you would be willing to sign a lease for longer then one year I may be able to help you out a bit.  Is that something that you would consider?
A lease for a year doesn't sound like a bad idea to me. I could push for $1480. Is that something you can agree too?,"In order for me to go down to 1480 I would need you to sign a 2 year lease.  Keep in mind that this does include lawn maintenance as well as hoa fees.  There is also a pool, club house and rec center that you will have access to as a member of this community."
Hmm... those sound like nice things to have. However I'm not too sure if I should sign a 2 year lease. What range are you looking for in order for me to sign a 1 year lease?,Well the owner does not want us to go any lower on a 1 year lease but let me ask how is your credit?  The reason that I ask is because if you have a score over 700 I can waive the security deposit.
"I would say my credit is fairly good. I'm also starting to think that a 2 year lease isn't really a bad idea. Oh, alright! I'll take the risk! I could make some good friend along the way too. So are you still willing to accept $1480 is I sign a 2 year lease?",Yes that is correct.
Hi I am very interested in this property. Can you tell me about the safety of this neighborhood?,The property is located in a very peaceful and safe neighborhood with very low crime rate.
"That sounds perfect for me and my daughter. I am ready to move in as soon as possible, and I would like to sign a 2 year lease, but the price is a little high. Would $1450 be acceptable?",I'm glad to hear you are so serious about it. It is a great place to live for young children. $1450 is a bit too low. How about $1650?
I can possibly afford $1600 if the garbage bill is included,Ok deal. Let's get the paperwork ready as soon as possible!
Yes I am. I just moved here from Chicago. I am presently staying in an Airbnb. Tell me more about the location please?,"Welcome to San Fransico! The property is outstanding and located in a very safe, quiet area of town. It's recently been remodeled and comes fully furnished."
Thanks so much. It's so hot here though. Does the room come with and air conditioning unit?,Haha the heat does suck here but yes the apartment has a working ac unit. Do you have anymore questions?
I can pay $990 and sign a 6 month lease immediately.,"Ok perfect, you can come into from 9-5 monday through friday. Ask for Kathy and she'll take care of you."
Hey there are you selling the iPhone 6 case?,"Yes, I am. It works for iPhone 6 and 6s. Are you interesting in buying?"
"Yes I am in need of an iPhone 6 case, and the candyshell inked case from Speck seemes pretty cool. I heard that it is very durable and scratch proof with great graphics. Can you attest to this? And what is the price you are asking for?","Yes, it is extremely durable. Has been thoroughly tested. It is scratch resistant and will protect your phone from any fall. I am asking for 25 but I am willing to negotiate a bit"
I would be very happy to get the phone case for $22. Do we have a deal?,"Sure, I can do 22"
"Hi, is this used or new?",This phone is used but with no issues.  It is in excellent condition.  Unlocked for any carrier you need.
"Good to know, I am wondering if you could come down in price? I am a student.",Since you are a student I would like to help you out.  I will come down to $225.
I was hoping for $190.,"I don't think I can go that low, sorry.  I would like to help you out though.  How about $215.00?"
do you have case you could throw in?,I do. So how about $215.00 and a case?
"Hello, I want the batteries! I would love them!",Cool. They are in excellent working order and are ready to be used.
Great1 Are they new?,"Not brand new. But, they are in great working order. How much would you like to pay for them?"
I would like to pay 7.,7 dollars is a bit low. How about ten dollars?
9 and we have a deal!,Sounds good. let's do 9.
"Yes, Im interested in paying $40. Is that something you can help me out with?","Yes, which phone would you like to have flashed?"
an Iphone 7,"Ah, okay no problem, iPhone's do cost a bit more money to flash though. My prices start at $50, but I'm feeling kind since it's Friday and I will flash your iPhone 7 for $45"
Ok! that works for me.,Perfect!

I just would like to now if there is anything wrong with it?,Nothing wrong with it. I'm just redecorating my apartment and it no longer fits my decor.
That's a shame! Well I have $40 cash on me that I'd be able to give you for this.,40 is lower than I would be willing to go. Don't forget it does come with a matching mirror. How's 60?
I have a twenty dollar gift card to the mall I could throw in with the $40. I just don't have 60 for it,The gift card goes to what store?
Anyplace in the local mall.,Okay it's a deal then. The gift card and 40.
Yes I am,the details are shown to the right do you have any questions
Do you know if there is a high crime rate near this area,very safe area with  a gated community

hello There! Im intereested in this beautiful house you are advertising,it indeed is a very beautiful house. and in a nice place

"Im skeptical, though still interested. Are you willing to negotiate on price? I'm willing to pay with cashiers check to guarantee funds, and I have ample references",yes we can sure come to the same price. how about 2400?
"Oh wow, thats a lot higher than I was expecting. I'm willing to maintain the lawn, and do yardwork around the outside of the house to maintain property values and keep the neighborhood happy. If I do that, would you consider something more in the ballpark of 1900?",that is too low
"Well howabout something like 1950? I keep a clean house, my family is not loud, and I have been told Im a good neighbor to have.",i wont come lower than 2300

4100 would be better but I am willing to meet you in the middle. How about 4750?,"Ok, I can live with that."

Wow this Planter Boxes are so lovely. How best will it fit at Home or in and Office?,These are so great they can fit practically anywhere!
Okay thanks. Will you be able to recommend where i can get the flowers. I love the ones in the picture,"I am sure you could get them cheap at any Walmart, anywhere with an outdoor gardening area."
I see. Its a great indoor decoration and i am willing to offer you $18 for the boxes,"That hardly covers the materials, let alone the labor on all of these boxes. Could we perhaps settle on an even $20? I do wish to eat something other than Ramen noodles for dinner tonight. You understand right?"
"Hey, you got a nice bike here?","Yes. Excellent shape, Less than 1k miles on it. Brand new."
Love the aluminum frames... they go so much faster down hills. Nothing wrong with it I hope? You just don't ride anymore?,"Nothing wrong with it. As I said, like brand new. Only 100 miles on it. I have some personal reasons for giving it up that have nothing to do with the quality of the bike."

"Hi.  I am interested in the chair and ottoman but because of the condition of the items, I would like to offer $35.",I understand. What specifically was the problem with the items?
The wood has scratches and the cushions have faded.,This item has a nice worn look. Brand new I saw these going for $250

For how long have you had them?,"Had them about 3 years, very clean. No marks and very minor scrapes."
How does $350 per cubicle sound?,Sure! I can do that.

How is the location around the area, and are there any safety concerns?","This is located in the epicenter of college life! Very safe area, low crime rate. Tons of nearby eating and People's Park. It's the perfect college student apartment with lots of social areas nearby!"
"Awesome! Now there may be an issue with the pricing, it is a little bit out of my range, but if you had any units that weren't as flashy as the others, or a leasing offer I could lock into ( I plan to finish my 4 years at the University), that would be great! Is there a way to lower the pricing down to around the $1400 - $1600 range?","Absolutely, we can do $1,500 with a 1 year lease, or $1,400 with a 2 year lease. Are you interested in either of those options?"
"$1400 with a 2 year lease sounds perfect, that would help me out a great deal!","Awesome! Welcome aboard, tenant!"

"Yes, I'm interested in the wall mount. Is the mount still sealed in the package?","Yes, it is brand new in package. I bought it a few months ago, and never got around to mounting the TV on the wall, and decided the TV is fine on it's stand. So, I'm outside the return window."

It's just too much.  I'm a college student and I spent most of my time working to pay my tuition when I'm not studying.,Well I can't really go too much lower than that because then that will be a loss for me! How about $1645?

Hello,This is a great Honda; so excellent I'm thinking it's worth $6900.
I don't think it's worth that much. It's a 12 years old car.,"True, but it has power seats and a cd player."
i like the power seats but cd player is outdated to me.,"Good point, and I guess it can catch fire. How do you feel about $6000?"
KBB says it's only worther about $3500. Would you consider $4000?,I'd really like to get $5800. Can we meet at $5000?
It's too high for me. My budget is around $4000,"I see. I can come down to $4200, which is one hundred times the answer to everything in the universe, and a very fair price."
how about $4100? it's only $100 different but would help me a lot. I can also come to pick up the car so you don't have to deliver.,"I'm not happy about it, but I need to sell. Agreed."
hi i really love that coffee table,Yes I agree its absolutely gorgeous and has a shelf underneath. Its wooded top!
i would like to purchase for 41,I could accept that its a fair deal! But you will have to come pick it up yourself?
Hello do you still have the etagere?,I do. Are you interested in buying it?
Yes I'm interested but I have a couple questions. What condition is it in?,It is actually in great condition.
Okay but are there any signs of wear and tear? Scratches? stuff like that,There is only one small scratch on the back of it near the bottom.
Okay since it's used can you negotiate the price a little?,I could negotiate a little bit. How much are you thinking?
Could you go to 30?,How about 35?
"hello, can you tell me more about this bed?","sure. it's a full size bed, from IKEA, only used as a guest bed, more to have one, than really for anyone to sleep in. it's in a really good condition"
I certainly am.  It's a beautiful car but your price way above book value.,thats fair market value actually and this baby is worth every penny. have you ever owned a Mazda before?
I have and they are great cars.,yes they are and this one is a 2016 with just 1523 so it spent more time in my garage than on the road
Well I have cash and looking for a great car like this.  How about I come by with 6000.00 and pick up the Mazda?,"Come on, that's way too low. I have people offering me double that very easily too. Wanna come up on the price?"
Ok.  How about 7500.00 in cash today?,Still too low. I can do 13000 but that's the absolute lowest I will go. This is an almost new car
"I love this car.  So I'm prepared to come with 12,500.",You've got yourself a deal!
I am. How does it run? Are there any scratches or anything on the exterior/interior?,"It rns great, smooth and quiet it's in great shape and only a year or so old. There was a slight collision that left some cosmetic damage on the driver door, but it is not a big deal."
Would you be willing to drop it off or would I need to come get it?,We can arrange it either way. It's not a big deal.
I can come get it if you're willing to lower the price to $14180,That could work. You can swing by anytime this weekend and pick it up and my phone number is listed here so you know who to call.
How long have you had the chairs?,I have had them less then 6 months and they are in great shape.
"Are there any cracks in the leather, scratches in the crome or any discoloration on the backs?",No I only used them once and they have been in my office storage since then.
Great! I noticed the post said you had about 7. Do you know exactly how many you have?,I have 7 of them and all are immaculate as if never used.
Is the wood backing dark or light? And is the purple a bright purple or closer to an eggplant shade?,The wood backing is a medium tone and the purple is more of an eggplant shade.
Perfect! I don't have a truck. Would you be able to deliver them?,I can if you are local that would not be a problem.
Great! I am local.,I am asking $500 for all 7.
Hello I see you have some furniture for 225.00,"Yes. There's alot of tables,hutches, dresser, lamps, and bed. We are getting new furniture, so we are clearing out the old stuff."
Nice,"The cherry wood is beautiful, you will love it."
Are you willing to take $100 and I'll have my friend with a truck go with me to pick it up?,There are eight pieces of furniture here. We've got to get at least 200. And you will need a big moving truck to fetch it all in one shot.
Can you meet me in the middle and take $150 then since I'll have to rent a big moving truck?,That sounds fair.
"Hi. I am interested in your desk, yes. 60 Sounds a bit high for me though. would you be willing to go down to 30?",i would meet you in the middle at 45. It's hard to let it go for too low. I bought it for 150. Would you be willing to pick it up at my house?
"I would be willing to pick it up, but how bout 35 since I am the one picking it up?",okay 35 will work. no later than noon tomorrow. see you then
Hi,HI!  How are you today?  Are you interested in our studio that is available?
"I'm doing fine, how are you and yes I am interested but am on a kindof tight budget",Ok well we are asking 1448 for it!
"I see, would you be able to negotiate some on that price?",What do you have in mind?
"Well I need to pay something like 700 but I'm sure that's too low for you, can we work something out?",Yes that's way too low.  This place is beautiful!  And has a ton of amenities such as 2 swimming pools !
"Yes I figured that was too low, that's what I was saying.  Is there anything good deal that you could offer to me?",I can do 1425 .....
"That's like 20 off, hmmm interesting, is there not a lower price you can do at all?",These are gorgeous units!  And the amenities will make you feel like a king.  It's well worth it!
Okay I understand but I was told you were willing to negotiate.  Are you able to come down any further than your offer of 20?  I hope this hasn't been a waste of time because I'm sure we could come to an agreement?,1400 is the lowest I can go!
"Hi, are you interested in my apartment","Hmm, says here that I'm the seller :)"
Hi! I am interested in your HUmvee for sale,It is an amazing vehicle. I'm a former army reservist and I can vouch for the authenticity of this humvee.
That's great! I like everything about it. I unfortunately do not have the budget to pay what you are asking. I am thinking in the ballpark of $16k,"I understand, that's bit low for how great I think this vehicle is and what I'm willing to part with it for. How about around $19000?"
"If I am willing to travel to you to pick it up, could we do $17500?","That's lower than I wanted to part with it, but you seem genuine so I will accept that offer."
Hi i am interested in your couch how much are you asking,i'mk asking 300 for it. it's a nice sofa
"If I come right away and pick it up would you take $275, I can come right now,","hm 275 is kinda low, man and i don't have time right now. how about tomorrow?"
How about $285 tomorrow and I can come what ever time is good for you?,"you know what, that's a deal. 285 tomorrow afternoon, after 4 pm works"
"Hi, yes, it seems to be just a bit out of my price range though.",What is the price you would be interested in?
"Well, I was wondering about the location and the number of bedrooms. How many people can it sleep comfortably?",This is a dual master so that means it has two master bedrooms. You could fit 3 in each bed so 6 people total.
"Well it would just be my wife and me. It will be nice to have the guest room too. We have no pets. Everything else about it sounds great, except that we have to commute to the city for work. We were thinking something more along the $2500-2800 range for a suburban home",If you contract to stay in the home for a  year we could bring the rent to $2800 a month.
That seems reasonable enough. The guest room won't be used often except when our parents come from out of town. They aren't messy but your price sounds fair enough.,Perfect I'll start on the paperwork.
Hello is this item still for sale?,"yes hi , it's a perfect bike"
Can you tell me a little about it?,"it's a light bike, easy to handle, fairly new, pro-bike, it's like no other bike, you should come and ride it if you don't believe me,"
What are you asking?,I ll let it go for 2600
Are the tires in good shape?,yes they are in perfect shape
Will you take 2000?,"I will take 2400 and I will deliver it , how about that ?"
Will you do 2200 and I will come pick it up since its a 100 mile drive?  It will save you on gas.,"i think i could that, only if you come tomorrow morning, because i might change my mind,fair enough ?"
"Hi, I just saw you have a scooter listed.  I like it.  Could you give me some information on it>","It is a fuzion Carving Scooter 4 wheel kick scooter , usual wear and tear on it, works great. 1 year old."
The picture looks like the scooter has been well used.  Would you be willing to take $15 if I pick it up with cash in hand?,"Sorry, this one is $40 firm.  It is the bigger version for adults and kids, not the smaller version for kids."
I can only go up to $25 max.,I can only do $40
"im sorry im not trying to swindle you at all, im short for cash at the moment and i really like the bookshelf",i know it's really beautiful. i don't really wanna get rid of it. but it's too heavy too move
would you do 26 if i come and move it myself,"I can meet you somewhere with it, I don't really want u to come over. that's kinda scary. for meeting u i'll go to 33"
since im meeting you and have to get a truck can you do 28,"i'll tell you what buddy, I'll go to 29 just for you, cuz u seem so desperate"
Hi I am interested in the bikeyou are selling for 250. Can you please tell me some details about it?,"Of course. It is a Man's bike, purple. It's a medium frame so it would be suitable for a man or woman. It's dated 1952 on the serial number. It is heavy so I wouldn't recommend it for daily use as a commuter. More like a weekend at the Farmer's Market type of bike."
"Sounds like a good ike. I see from the photo that it looks old and has some wear to it. Because of that, I am only willing to offer $175. Is that good?","No. I would need an offer closer to my asking price. Say, $225?"
"Wow, this looks like a great car! I'm interested!",I have the price listed at $4000.
"Okay, how many miles?",114K
Thats way too many for that price. How about 3000,"Well I did just give it a tune up and oil change. Also, I recently changed the head gasket and erg valve."
"That all helps a lot! I will go up to 3,400.","It does also have leather heated seats, and a new stereo deck."
"Thats great, but thats my offer.","could you do $3,600?"
hi! is the monitor stil for sale?,Yes it sure is!
Does it have any issues?,No it doesn't have any issues at all. Its in a great working condition. I just want to get rid of it because I wanna get a newer one.
i would like to offer $125 plus pick up today!,"I can give you $130. Its an LED monitor, and you can't go wrong with the product I can assure you that."
Good.  How are you?  I am interested in your phone is it still available?,It is its like brand new! the only condition is that is locked to sprint's network so you will have to use them. I am only asking  99 dollars for it which is an absolute steal!
That is not really a steal sorry to tell you.  That same phone on the Sprint network is only $62 at walmart so I could give you $55,I just looked it up they go for 150 at walmart the lowest i will be able to go is 80 dollars will you accept that?
How old is the Fender amp?,"It's only 5 years old, it's in great condition. The only thing you have to worry about is a slight bit of rust in the corners, but that should come off with some elbow grease."
"Okay, would you say the amp works perfectly?","Yes, it's extremely loud. I can include the amplifier cord to go to the guitar as well. Does $45 sound good?"
I was actually thinking more like $30 since it's 5 years old and has some rust on the corners.,"Well, you'd have to pick it up if I went anything below $37, which I don't think I can do."
I can come pick it up in an hour with cash in hand!,"You need to be here in 30 minutes, I have someone else interested for it at $40 but I'll go with you if you can get here in time."
I am on my way! Thanks,Thank you.

Hi. What is the condition of this item?,This is in great condition and as you can see 100% financing is available.
"I have cash on hand and would love to purchase without financing, you would have to go a little lower in price though.","Well that is possible, what are you able to pay today?"
"Considering I have seen something similar go for 1200 over a year ago, and it was in mint condition, I think $1100 would be a more fair cash price.",I want to be as fair as possible for the both of us. Can you take it today for 1500?
"I have been through Dixon, you don't have a lot of business that way. I will go $1250, unless you can sweeten the pot by offering some extra services?",I can go to $1260 and its a deal!
"Hi, I am interested in your F150. How many miles does it have on it?",It has about 234K of mostly highway driving
"Wow, it's kinda high...anything wrong with the truck? Does it have a clean title?",The title is clean. The price is actually fair for the condition the car is in. I have put in a lot of money to maintain this truck so that it runs as well as it does.
Will you consider 10000? I'm thinking the mileage is a bit high for 2010...,"The F150 is an expensive truck new, and used. I can do down to 10500, but anything less is giving ti away."
That sounds fair. Can I come take a look this afternoon?,sure
Hi! I'm interested in your Toyota.,"Helllo! sure, it has a clean title, mileage is 155K, leather seats, sunroof, navigation, ac and heat, tires and breaks are good and clean from inside out"
"Is it generally in good condition? Any dents or scratches, or anything I should know about?","no no dents, and yes in good condition"
"I can't quite see what color the car is from the photo, is it black or navy blue?",it is navy blue
Would you be willing to come down on the price a bit?,yes I'm willing to go lower but not too low
"Okay, what do you say if I come pick it up today and pay $6200 cash?","why yes, you have yourself a deal"
"Hi, I really like this bike. Is it in good condition?","Yes, I  rode it a couple of times and no damage or wear."
Great. I want to come by and take a look at it. Can I come by around noon tomorrow?,"Yes, I will be available."
Can I get you to lower the price to 2500?,"Could we do $3,000 and I will come to you."
"That could work. How bout I come to you and you knock off only 2000 more, so 2800?",Deal.
Thank you very much,You are welcome.
I sure am. Is the one posted still open?,yes it is!! do you have any questions about our beautiful apartments?
"If I paid 6 months up front, could you do $1600?",I couldn't do 1600 for 6 months payment but maybe if you were to pay 12 months in advance?
I could probably swing that. I can come by and do a walk through and sign tomorrow if you have some time. 3PM good?,I will definitely be here and I can also provide you more information on the area.

I can not remove the hardwood as the original from 1900. If you have excellent credit I could may do an even 3000
i have excellent credit but how about 2800,Sorry I can't go that low as I still have to pay the mortgage on this place as well as upkeep. I'm afraid I can't go below 3000. We are having an open house Saturday and this won't last long.
ok how about 2900,Well if you can go 2950 it would save me the trouble of holding the open house.

"Okay, I will take it and come get it today if you would like.",That sounds great!  Thank you!
"Hello, Are you willing to negotiate on price? $40 is too much",Actually the ad says the seat is for sale at $50. But I may be winning to come down on the price if you're willing to provide your own transportation.
Oops sorry my mistake that was a typo! I would be willing to pay $35. I have cash in hand and will pick it up today.,How about $40 and you pick it up?
I'd like to pay $7 for it. I can come and pick it up from your place if that makes it any better.,$8. Finally offer
"hello! i am interested in you tacoma you have posted, how many miles are on it?",125 original miles.
what kind of work have you done on it in the past year or so,I haven't had to do a lot. Just do regular scheduled maintanenc. It's a great truck and looks even better.

Yes I am interested and I have a couple questions. Does it come with appliances and what kind of flooring does it have?,"yes, all appliances are included, fridge, dishwasher, washer and dryer, all are pretty new and in good condition"
Okay that sounds good. Is there anyway you could work with me on the price per month?,maybe a little bit - the floors are carpet and laminate by the way - I could go as low as $2000 but that is my bottom line
"Will you do $1,900 if I sign an extended lease? Other places usually offer a discount for the extended lease",I can do 1950 and a 2 year lease if that works for you

Great. What brand is it?,It's a Marantz. Very reliable brand.  I'm asking $949 which is below market.
"Wow, ok. I have a budget of about 460 for a used amplifier.",Oh my.  That's lower than I anticipated.  How about $900?  Would that work?  I'll throw in our remaining Sirius XM membership.
"The XM offer is great, but that's still way out of my price range. Does it come with any kind of warranty?","There's about 8 months left on the warranty, which should help you.  How about if we meet in the middle somewhere about $725?"
"I could probably pull a little extra money out of savings, although my partner may kill me. I could do 575","If you can do $650 while still on speaking terms with your partner, it's a deal."
"Well, you did say it comes with a warranty and the remaining XM membership. So, you've got a deal.",Sounds Great!
"Doing great, how about yourself?",I'm well thanks! Are you interested in my phone? It's pretty good condition it has a small crack on the bottom and a scratch on the screen that's why I'm only asking 150 for it.

"hello, can you tell me a little bit about this table and chair set","Hey there! These chairs are well made Mahogany chairs, as well as the base for the table. No bumps, marks, gouges, stains, chips, or scratches on the wood whatsoever. The glass table is well made, and thick, as well as clean. The price is $149 all together."
that's a little bit more than I wanted to spend. would you let me take them off your hands for $120?,We can settle with $120 if you can find your own way of getting them to your place. Whether that's a moving truck or a personal pickup truck. Do we have a deal?
great. I'll bring my truck and pick them up. 120 it is!,"Awesome, see you then!"
Does it have any scratches/scuffs or anything like that?,"No, it's in like-new condition"

I could do $85 and we're picky about sheets because of allergies but thank you.,"That seems a little lower than I can do. I can come down a bit, but you'll need to do better than that."
Can you deliver it?,"I have a van, so that shouldn't be a problem, but I'll really need around $135 to make it worth my while"
I can go $110 delivered.,125 is the best I can do.
I can't for more than $115.00,I really can't do less than $125
If you go ahead and put the sheets with it I'll do $120.00,"For 125, I'll throw in the sheets, but with that and delivery, I think that's more than a fair price"
"Okay, I'm interested. Is there anything wrong with this sub?",The only thing wrong with it is that the previous owner was a lying cheating piece of a man.
"Hmm, so you'd say that your judgement might not be so good?",Oh my judgement is just fine. This thing is not welcome in my house anymore.
"Well, if it's that important to get it out of your house fast, I'd be happy to offer $200 right now.",Well probably is the court says I owe him 400 so I need at least for his garbage so I can pay him.
"Well, I think if we work together we can come up with a mutually beneficial arrangement.",Such as?
"Well, how about I pick up the subwoofer from you tonight, and I'll pay $300 for it.",That still leaves me 100 short. I really need 400
"Well, without some other perks I really can't go any higher than $300.",I'll deliver it to you. And throw him some of his clothes that are hanging around my house.
What size are the clothes?,Large
"Well, okay, if you'll come over here, tonight, with the sub and the clothes, I think we can make a deal at $400.",Thank you! It is all yours!
Hi I am interested in this car. Can you give me more details?,Hello I have here a reduced price vehicle that might be perfect for you!
Which one?,This is a Dodge 3500 4x4 with a welding rig.  Also the vehicle is an automatic so I hope that will be okay?  We have put on new tires on the front and also new brakes and locks on the doors.  How does that sounds?
What's the price?,"The price is 11500 which was already reduced.  Also there is more too there are many high dollar tools involved with the sale if you like.  I have for you a diesel machine, dual oxygen bottle rack, stinger missile case as a toolbox, I also have a Pac rat tool box too and some smallers tools would you like details about the smaller tools?"
"I really like it, but the price is too much!",I see maybe there is a compromise.  If you only want the truck without any of the tools then I can let it go for 8500 or something like that?
Okay that sounds great. My budget is 8049,"Okay so you want just the truck for, can you do 8100 so it is even?"
okay then we got the deal 8100,Okay sounds great I will look forward to meeting with you!

I'd be willing to come get it and buy it without a road test, even though there's no picture","it's pretty light given it's made of sturdy steel. and brake squeaking can be fixed with new pads. no biggy, i can do that for you. but 60 is too low, i can't let it go for anythign below, say, 120?"
"I can't do 120, even with new pads. Can we do 100 with pickup?",hm... that's just too low man. i can't do 100 for this bike.

That's too much for me.  I can do 900.  Is there a yard?,The unit comes with either a patio or a balcony. 900 is far too low for us to consider.

Hi! I'm interested in the couch you have for sale.,"It is nice, well taken care of and clean.. No kids!"
"Great! But, you can tell it has been used, and it isn't new. Would you take $115 for it?",I am afraid I need to sell it for $150. New couch from IKEA will be around 450

How about I pick it up and I give you $130?,Ok. Will see you soon
This is nice but don't you think 200 is a bit much?,It's a antique and in perfect condition.
Yes but that's too high. I'd give you 110 for this.,That's almost half of what I'm offering.  I can let it go for 175.
I could go to a thrift shop and get one for that price,This is one of a kind. You won't find a vintage mirror like this in a thrift shop
One of a kind? Are you sure abut that? If so how about 120?,I welcome you to find another one like it.  I certainly doubt you would find it for any less than 150
"hello, I am interested in your chair. How good of shape is it in?","It is in excellent condition, almost like new."

I really like those chairs. I think they would look absolutely fabulous in my house. Would you be willing to accept $94 each?,"I could go down to $110 if you come pick it up today, I have a move going on."
"Hello, is the truck still for sale?","Yes it is. I am asking 27500 and it is in great shape, with just one minor dent. It was just serviced a month ago and still has 65,000 miles on its warranty."
Hi there. I am interested in your property for sale. Is the price at all negotiable and can you tell me some things about it,It is newly renovated and has all new appliances. It is located in a great area. It is on the top floor. We are asking $3000 a month for rent.
That is a bit out of  my budget.,What is your budget?
2280 but I can go higher if there are special amenities,There are many amenities. The location is right next to a freeway and there is a shopping mall next door. The home features a washer and dryer as well as being pet friendly.
Ok sounds good. Would you accept an offer of 2280?,"No, we need to get at least $2600."
"hi, is the house still available?",It sure is. Were you looking to buy it?
I'd like to lease it for about 6 mos. to a year.  We just moved to this area and are looking for a nice house to rent.,"Well look no further, This home will be ready June 12th at a very fair price!"
Are there appliances and are the utilities included in the price?,"The appliances are not included, but all utilities are included in rent."
hmmm...that's an expense I was not counting on.  What do you call a fair price?,"$4000 Is the asking price, I can assure you it is worth well over that."
I think 4000 is a little high for a house with no appliances.  I was looking more at 2200,The work we have put into the house is worth alot more than the asking price as is... I suppose I could agree to have appliances installed for you if you are willing to give me at least $3500
Now you're talking.  I think we have a deal!,Great! I'll be happy to see you in your new home!
I am doing well. How are you?,Very good..  Thanks for asking!
"I see this is listed for $2551, is that correct?","Yes, that is correct!"
Could it go down to closer to $1800?,"I would really like to get at least $2100.  It has so much stuff to offer!  Not to mention, a great view!"
Is there any local attractions close by?,"Nice parks are close as well, San Francisco isn't far either.  Are you looking for something in particular?"
"I can do $1900, but not much more.",Ok..  I will sell it to you for that.
"Hello, I am interested in your Chevy. I see that you are asking $5,000, is the price negotiable?",I have a little wiggle room.
Is there any body damage?,"No, it is in really good shape."
"I have looked at comps and I am willing to pay $3,000","I couldn't go that low, I would drop the price to $4,500 for you"
"It just doesn't appear to be worth $4,500. Would you be willing to take $3,500","I assure you that this is a nice vehicle and is worth the money. I am needing cash so I would go down to $4,000"
"I only have $3,800 but I have it in cash and can be there in a couple hours.","$3,800 if you are here in a couple hours with cash."
"Hi, yes I'd be willing to offer $85",it's slightly lower than what i can do... it's an Adam... it's fold-able and i can throw warriors flags too... how about 92
That's very generous.  I can do $90.,and what about pickup? can you pick it up from me?
Absolutely.,"great, nice to do business with you. 90 and done?"
hello,Are you interested in buying this product?
"I am interested in the product, does it come with any accessories?","Yes, it comes with the plastic screen rap too."
Does it come with a stylus or earbuds or phone case?,Phone case and I will throw it in for free.
"I would really like to have ear buds too, can we add that to the deal?","Yes, is 400 dollars okay with you? That seems like a fir price to me."
"If you throw in the phone case and ear buds for free then I can pay the $400, yes.",I will. Sounds good.
Hi yes I'm interested. Do these come with light bulbs?,"Yes, they do with medcentury mod modern mcm lighting. It's in great vintage condition!"
Are there any stains or cracks on them?,There are none whatsoever. This is a steal if you like vintage antiques!

"Hello, I am interested in this apartment. Could you please tell me if this apartment is furnished?",No it does not come furnished.
Okay thanks.. I'd have to furnish this apartment and I just got a new job working as an ecologist in the bay area. Eventually I could afford to pay full price but would like to negotiate if possible until I can get more acclimated.,"I can work with you on the price within reason, do you have an offer?"
"Hey there id love to buy this place, it seems like its in the perfect location for me!",It's definitely in a great location!
"How much are you guys looking for? I see it has some great amenities so I'm sure its a lot, but I might be able to afford such a place.",It's $3500. Fully furnished. It'll be available from June 15-August 15. $3500 for 2 months is a great deal for this neighborhood.
Would you guys be willing to drop it just a tad to $3000? I was only trying to pay around $2000 but this is such a good deal im willing to go out of my budget.,"I've got a few people interested already. However, I don't mind dropping the price a little. Would you be able to do $3300? It includes everything you could possibly need."
Yes. I think the photo of the unit is nice but I think the price is a little too high considering the lack of amenities. Would you be willing to negotiate a lower price?,"Possibly. However, the vanity was recently updated and I will be covering a portion of the rental fee. What price were you thinking?"
$1530 roughly,"Hmm that's a little low, I can't accept that. Central Alameda is a really popular area right now and I couldn't take less than $1600 for it. The hardwood floors are in pristine condition!"
"HI, I'm great! I'm really interested in the canondale comfort bike. Says it's been sitting for a few years. how long have you had it?","I bought it a few years ago, but really haven't used it as much as what I thought I would.  It is in good condition.  Cleaned and ready to go."
Is it silver or white? Are there any tears in the seat?,"It is silver and no tears at all!  Great condition, aside from sitting."
I really want it but I only have $100. Could you sell it for that?,"I am sorry, but that is a bit to low.  I could do $125!"
deal,Awesome.  Thank you!
Hi. I am interested in your iphone.,Hey there!
The phone appears to have plastic still on it. Has it been used at all?,"Awesome! It's matte black and has 64GB of storage. It's like new, slightly used, but very brief. No marks, dents, scratches, or anything. Good as new. $320 for it."
This is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go lower? I could come pickup myself at $250,"It's a new Iphone 6, you wont find one for $250. $300 is the lowest I'll go i'm sorry. I can deliver it to your place if that makes it any better price wise."
"This is a great phone, I can give you $200.00 for it.",320
2 60 please,How about 275?
ok 275,Perfect.
"Hello I am interested in this studio, what area is this studio located, good or fair?",It's in Lake Merritt
"OK, and when was it last updated?",It was renovated in 2014. We have a newer modern kitchen and white subway tile in the bathroom.

"If you include utilities that is a great price, if not would you accept 1750?",I'm sorry we can't do utlities as well. We would accept $1750
"Nice car, I am on a mission to get a new car.  I see you have selling price a little higher than my budget.",I am open to negotiate.  It is two years old and has 32000 miles and brand new tires.
How does $11700 sound to you? I could get that today from the bank with a check.,Make it a cashiers check and we have a deal?
Yes it will be certified. I will bring it with me of course. Can I come today?,Yes
I'm interested in your leather sofa. I think it would look great in my living room. Would you take $243?,"It is actually a sofa and loveseat, so I can't go that low.  They come from a smoke free and pet free home.  I could go $300"
Is it soft?,Yes and very comfortable
"I have a bad back, so I don't want to sink down too far. Would you take $250?",You only came up $7?  I tell you what.  I will deliver it to you and $275 is the lowest I can go.
Does it clean easily?,"Yes, $275?"
"Could you deliver it today? And could you put it in my house, please? I'm 85 years old.","Yes, no problem, so $275 it is then"
"Hey there, cool phone. What can you tell me about it?",Phone is like new and runs great .

Hi. I am interested in this bike. May I ask how tall it is?,The seat reaches roughly 35 inches high.
Ok. I was thinking of getting a bike like this for my son.  How low would you go on the price?,"If you can come pick it up today, I'd do $290. I think your son would love it!"
I think he would too. Could you go as low as $210? I am on a budget.,"That's a little lower than I'd like to go. The bike has very few miles on it and is almost like new. Similar bikes sell for almost $400, I'm only asking $300 because I need the money. How about $285? That's fifteen dollars lower than I really wanted to go."
I can come up to $275.,How about we split the difference at $280 and your son can be riding this amazing bike within the hour!
"Hey there, I love this watch! it looks fantastic, what can you tell me about it, price wise and quality/condition wise?",I'm asking 185 for it which if you've ever priced an apple watch you know that is a deal. As far as condition it is barely used. I bought it but never had much of an occasion to use it.
"Okay that makes sense! very reasonable price. I can do 185 for it if you can deliver it to my place. Can you do that for me? it would be a big help, thanks a lot!",yeah I can deliver it if you are willing to pay 185
"Hello, is the camera still available?","yes, I still have it."
"I'm interested in  it and I would like to offer $35. I'm not trying to be a low-baller, I'm just on a tight budget. And yes, I like wine and whiskey!",Is there any way you could go up a bit or maybe throw in a bottle of wine or something?  $35 is a bit low.
"Well, since I can't see the item, how about I come up and check it out and if I deem it sound enough, i'll pay $40? How does that sound?",That sounds fair.
Do you pay monthly animal rent for each animal?,Yes we do.
yeah. they look great. looks like sating cover?,"They are light and medium brown cushions on top of excellent, heavy duty wrought iron chairs.  The cushions are super comfortable!"
"i meant satin. but ok. tell you what. I'll give you 100 cash. i pick up. if we have a deal, i can do it today",Perfect!  My new set is being delivered tomorrow and I'll be home today.  We have a deal at 100 cash.

"ok wounds good i read the description, looks like  a project id be interested in working  on...So your asking for $50?","yep, i say it's a steal. it will make a great project. it's probably the power source problem, if you know how to solder, you can fix it no problem"
Hi!,Hello how are you doing today? Are you interested in our offer today? Two for the price of one. $50
I am very interested in your offer! What is the condition of the bookcase does it have scratches dings dents etc?,"Well it does have a bit of wear and tear but nothing major that is the reason why we are selling the two bookshelves for the price of one. Cosmetically it is in good shape and as far as durability, it is very sturdy."
That sounds good would you accept 45 if i came today to pick them up?,Yes I can work with that. You have a deal
Yes. How long have you had this washing machine?,I've gotten it only a year ago and it was brand new. No dings or scratches on it. Works like a charm and runs quiet. i'm only asking $100
Would you accept $90?,I will accept $90 if you come out and pick it up and pay in cash.
Sure. Can I come tomorrow?,I will be in all day tomorrow.You have my number just text me when you are about to arrive and I will get it ready for loading.
How long have you had this car? I am interested.,"I have owned it since 2002, so 15 years. I'm the original owner."
"Any accidents, dents, or marks?",No accidents or dents. The paint is in decent condition. It is the original paint job so it has some wear and tear.
Would you accept $1500 cash in I will get it today since you had it for 15 years which is a pretty long time,I'm sorry but I am not able to go that low. I'm willing to work with price but not that far. Would you be more interested if I threw in a Alpine stereo to replace the stock radio?
Yes how about $2750 cash,$2750 in cash sounds good. We should be able to finish the transaction quickly. Thank you.
"Hi, how does your TV mount attach to the wall?","Hi, it attaches via screws with anchors - I will include all of the hardware with it. It is nice and secure and held my 65 inch tv perfectly."
"Okay, that's good. Do you know about how much your TV weighed?","Mine weighed about 80 pounds, but the mount is rated for up to 130. It definitely feels secure enough for that."
"Okay. The ad says the box was never opened, though?","Yes, this is the same mount I use on my bedroom tv. This one is brand new in box."
"Perfect, just wanted to make sure! Would you sell it for $30 if I pick it up myself?","It retailed for over 100, so I definitely can't let it go for that low. I could give it for 50, if you pick it up"

Water and garbage are covered by landlord and there is a new dishwasher and stove.  Basically move in ready."
"That's awesome but I can only afford about 700 a month, hoping to work off the rest","I am sorry!  I can't go that low at all..  The lowest I could go is $1,050.."

So this salvage title... what made the small accident so small?,We bought this car at a law enforcement auction. The salvage title means you can't register and drive the car. It'f for parts only. There just a small dent in the rear quarter panel. Otherwise the care is in very good condition and low miles. It's a goldmine for parts.
Could I drive it on private lands without issues?,"Oh yeah, you can do that. Just stay off of paroled roads. IT's really just for parts. If you have a body or repair shop, then you can charge what ever you want for the parts."
"In that case I think I'm going to have to cut that price in half there, and meet you at $8375.","I could let it go for $12,500. Could you do that?"
"That's still too low partner, we're looking at maximum $9000. It's a useless car, and will take me a while to sell the parts.","I'm sad to hear that. My rock bottom price is $11,000.  If you can see your way to make that great."

Are they ready for move in at this time?,Whenever! These are available now for a one year lease. Rent is due at the price of $2200. How does that sound to you?
A bit higher than I expect for the neighborhood. Crime database shows there's been an increase in home robberies the past year.,"That is understandable, but we do have other people making offers for this space. The lowest I will go is $1850 a month."
I can lease for about $1600 a month.,$1725 a month and you have a deal!
"After considering the costs of utilioties, and security deposit, the absolute maximum I can afford is $1672.",Deal!
Yes I'm interested in the Samsung Galaxy. How long have you had it and what condition is it in?,"ive had it for less than a year, but its in great shape. it comes with a UAG urban armor case, and its been in that case since it came out of the box. it never even left the store out of the case!"
I seen them selling on Amazon new for about $320 so are you willing to sell them for 250?,yeah! 250 is great.
Hey there id love to buy a fitbit! Are they good quality?,"Great quality, I just have the one fitbit because I bought one for my son and wife but my son didn't want it"
"Nice! So they work very well? Do you like them, do you find they help monitoring your workouts better?","Yeah, I personally have this generation one too, it's so nice to use with RunKeeper or the FitBit app it comes with. Do you work out a lot?"
"Yes that's why I want to get one. I hear it makes working out a lot more efficient. I'm looking to spend around $30, whats the lowest you can sell me one for today?",Oh I only have this one and it's literally in the box. Can you give me 50 for it? If you went to the store it'd be like 80
Hi I am interested in the firestick. Does  it work as it should? Also do you get a lot of networks?,"Yes, it is in very good condition. How much are you looking to pay?"
Well I am on a budget and that is why I want the firestick but I am willing to offer you 65.00,How about 70 and I will bring it to you myself?
"That would be great, I can do 70.00 Thanks, you got a deal","Great, Thank you"
hi what are the benefits on this location,"well it's a gated community, laundry and pool on site, it's very close to shopping and restaurants and close access to the freeway"
I like the area but the price is way out of my range,what price is in your range
1275 would be good for me to try it out,"I cannot accept 1275 that's way to low, the least i can accept would be 1995.  this is an exclusive area with many ammenities."
"way too far for my budget , 1995 is still too high for me",I could go for a month to month lease at 1574
what can you offer me with that price,It would be the same apartment just on a month to month lease.
"ok let round it to 1500 and let me sign the contract, deal",I have to get 1574.  I'm already giving it away.  I cannot do 1550
"Hello there, I am interested in the Wooden Cabinet","cool, its a very durable and stylish cabinet"

Could we do something like $62?,i can do $65
"Hey there, this place looks pretty enticing, what can you tell me about it to sell it to me.",It's a beautiful single family home in a great location with lots to do nearby.  Are you interested?
"Yes I am, the location seems great. Is the inside nice and clean? Im looking to spend around $2155",I will pay your moving expenses if you can do $2350.  Would that work for you?
How are you?,Good and you?

yes I am and I can pick it up and myself. I don't need delivery of it or anything like that.,Oh great.  It's a beautiful piece and fits in many rooms.  I'm looking at a price tag of $60.  If you are good you can get it anytime tomorrow.
That's $20 above list price. I can't make that happen. I was looking to offer $28,"Yea. So,Enoch else offered asking price but needed delivery. So let's find a solution for both of us. $35 if you pick it up?"
I can definitely work with that. Sounds fair to us both.,Fabulous see ya tomorrow
"Yes, I see that the chain could be replaced and that the rear break line is missing",Yes considering the chain and the rear brake I dropped the price to $90 but everything else is very good on it and the pegs are actually worth a lot.
$90 seems like alot considering the two missing things,The pegs alone are worth an extra $70 because they are limited edition pegs which are going for about $40 used and everything is in good condition no scratches or anything.
"I could find the bike new for $130 online, on Amazon, I was originaly thinking $50 because of the two things missing (considering that the bike chain alone could cost up to $100 for a new one, and the labor for the break cable could cost a bit.",I'll sell it for $70 without the rims and the pegs do we have a deal?

"No, thank you. I am trying to make a move on a property today. This is one of several I am considering. This unit is in the less savory area of town so it seems a little pricey. Could you reduce the payment to $1700?",Well I did consider that when I listed the property.  Some of the features are stainless steel appliances including a washer and dryer.  If you can get to $1750 I think we can make a deal.
I do love stainless steel! Deal!,Great!

I'm willing to offer $2.50,My final price is 2250 sines it is in a good neighborhood  near everything and fully equipped.
I think we are not chatting about the same item here. I'm trying to buy a ballistic iPhone 5 hard core case,"No, it is not a iPhone 5 case, it is a Berkeley Furnished B&B unit"
I think there is a problem. We are both connected to different items and It is impossible to negotiate a deal. The best thing is to quit this dialogue,"yes, not sure why we have different items.. Lets quit the dialogue"
"Hello, I am interested in the truck you have listed.",Yes it is really in great condition.
How many miles? Has it been wrecked?,It has been driven 50000 miles.

Do you think you would be willing to bring down the price since it is somewhat damaged?,"Maybe a little, however It is fairly new so I would like to get close to what i paid for"
"well a used product can rarely fetch the price paid, I was thinking  $59 and I can come pick it up myself.",I would consider $75
I feel that is too much since it is damaged already and have to try to repaint and repair it.,The paint is very fresh and does not need a new coat. The price I paid last year was $300 so you are getting it for less than 1/3

The new set is due by the end of the week."
"Any chance I could come see the set now?      If I like what I see I can even pay for the set TODAY in full CASH. . . .  .. .    its just the asking price is the issue.     I could leave set with you until Friday or Saturday when your new set arrives  if you would be willing to accept $1,800?     :)",You can certainly come see this now.

Hi there!  Can you describe the apartment a little bit-- I noticed there's no picture.,"It's a beautiful one bedroom in the bay area, very close to the Bart line. It's roomy and spacious, and I can show you in person if you'd like to meet?"

"I am really poor, and have no other transportation. I can scounge up $115, and I can through in a pan of fresh brownies","You are killing me as I really do not want to sell it to this other guy as I know him personally and he abuses his bikes, but that is way under what I paid for it. The Shimano gears alone cost me an extra $50 to add. I paid over $500 for this bike. How about this, since you see like you are a great person, just starting out financially and I remember being there. Price is $150 and you give me $100 now and $50 in two weeks, We sign and agreement and you pick it up today"

Do you have the ability to drop it off or do we need to pick it up?,"i can drop it off for an extra fee, 75 if you scoop it, 100 if i drop it"
We will pick it up. I am interested but not for $75. How about $50 and we'll come scoop it up today so its off your plate.,"I have a lot of other interested people. 75 dollars is more than reasonable for a frame and mattress, 75 is as low as i go, period."
Unfortunately I am not able to go above $60 for the bed and the frame. If you throw in the bedside table I'll bump it up to $75.,"Sorry, like i said, 75 is as low as i go. If you are looking to spend only $50, i suggest Big Shot Bob's Bedbug Infested Beddery."
Yes! I was curious the condition of it and about how old it is.,It is in excellent condition. Only had it a year. No scratches or nothing.
"Awesome! I can come and pick it up today, but would you be willing to take $100.00 for it?",Yes I could. Can you get it by 5 pm?
Absolutely!,We have a deal than. See you than.
"Hello, I am interested in the Silverado, but have a few questions. First, how many miles does it have on it? Second, honestly, are there any issues, minor or major?","It has 30,000 miles on it and it really runs like new no problems whatsoever and it's in excellent condition."
"Wow, amazingly low miles for 2001. Well, of course I will need to see it in person, but contingent on your information and if we can come to an agreement, I would like to purchase it. I can offer you 5000, cash!","Yes it's only been driven locally for work so it doesn't have many miles for its age. Given the excellent condition and low mileage I need at least $6,800"

Does it ocme with a home warranty at all,We do all the repairs and maintenance as a part of the lease. You are responsible of keeping the landscape according to HOA guidelines.
"Ok, how much are you asking?",It is $2599 a month.
"Ok well, my research shows that this price is to high for this neighborhood.  The other houses are going for much cheaper.  Will you lower your price at all?",We can offer you $100 discount per month if you sign one year lease.
I will be willing to go as high as 2000 for a 2 year lease.,"Sorry, we cannot agree to that term."
Hi I offer you $25,"It's still under warranty and I can throw in the cables, how about 50?"
done,"50 it is, make the offer"
Hello I see you have an apartment for rent,"Yes, it's 2200 a month."
Could you tell me about the amenities?,"Well, it's close to the UC Berkeley campus, so if you are a student, It's close to where you need to be. There's plenty to do in the area."
"Yes, that's my school, so that's convenient. Could you tell me what kind of food is available at the Durant Food Court?",I'll put it this way: it has everything. It's very diverse in it's cultural representation.
"Oh great! So there's 1 bedroom, is laundry included?",Not on the site but there is a couple of them within a few blocks.
"Oh darn, that's sort of inconvenient. Could you come down on the price a little since I'll have to travel to the laundromat and pay for the coin machines? I was thinking $1550","Yeah, that'd be a little too low for us. We could do 2100 and throw in free internet."
"That's just too high. I get internet on my phone so I don't need that. It's really difficult for me to get around due to a disability so the laundry being so far means I'll have to take a cab + pay the laundry machines. I could do $1,700 but no more","I understand, I am myself disabled and I know how tough it is to find affordable housing. How about this. We will cover your utilities if you can do 2000"
I am can you tell me a little about it?,"It is a 1 bedroom unit, full size washer and dryer included. The utilities are also all included, it is in the perfect location. I am asking 2250 for the unit"
would you consider 1500? I've seen comps in the area for around that much.,This one is one of the nicest in the area. You have access to the rooftop that gives an amazing view of the whole bay. I can do $1850
how about 1700 I can meet you half way,sounds like a deal
Hello.  I'd like to buy the bike for 104.,"That is a little low for me, I am willing to come down slightly."
The most I will pay is 115.,well would you be willing to pick it up?
yes I will pick it up,I cannot include the helmet or pump at that price.. or you can have them if you can come up to 145
I don't want the helmet or the pump.  Just the bike.   115 okay?,120 if you can come get it and you have a deal.
I think 115 is a fair price as the one tire has cracks.   115 and I will pick up.,"Sorry that is just too low for me, it was already a price cut at the listed 149."
yes can you you tell me more about the bike?,I've had it for about 3 years. Haven't ridden it alot because I realized it doesn't match my lifestyle
I understand is it in good condition?,"It's in great condition. I bought it new and then, like I said hardly rode it"
would you take $70 for it?,"I can't go that low, but I'd do $85"
how about $78 and I will pick it up from you.,That works
yes,I don't know much about phone cases.  I bought this for my husband and found out it was the wrong case.  It's brand new still in the package and I'm asking $4
I work in NYC and had been renting there as well but its ridiculously expensive.   Is this per month?     I am just thinking close to 1000/month as my rent in nyc is 1200 month,"Yes this is the per month price. I would not be able to go that low. This apartment is brand new, partially furnished, and has wood flooring. Similar apartments in the area are going for around $1700 so this is really a steal!"
how about 1400/month but I will put 1000 down right now.,$1450 is the lowest I can go
Is this real or faked?,This ad is real.
But you're no? ok,"i am, are you intrested in the bike?"
no,Put in a offer and ill accept or reject it.
Hey there!,"Hello, how are you?"
Good thanks! What can you tell me about this car? It looks nice!,It is a nice and reliable car. It drives well with no issues at all. It is an automatic and is very clean
"Very nice. So how much are you selling it for? I was trying to get a nice car for $2700, would that work for you?",I am trying to get
Could you do $2850 and I'll come pick it up?,I am trying to get 3000 out of it and I think that 2850 is a good and fair offer. You have a deal
hi,hello are you interesred in the bed that I am selling?
Hello. I am interested in your '13 Mercedes Benz.,Great!  Since the car is in such excellent condition I am seeking $20800 for it.
Tell me why you're going to discount it down from $19 first,"I can't deny, they do deserve a decent price of around $19, what will you use them for?"
For my non-profit medical clinic for those without health insurance,"Wowzo, I'm going to be a doctor today someday too. You want them for 18?"
I can really only do $13,"But you already asked why they were discounted from $19, I'll give you them for $15 final offer"
306?,"I am supposed to go no lower than 350 (this is according to my wife)  she will probably be so mad at me if I don't get at least that, what do you say?"
I can go up to 315.,"Dang what if we call it 330 and I will throw in the extra 20 so I don't get in trouble and then also I will give you some books on BMX stuff?  They teach you all types of neat things about riding and other things, are you interested?"
Deal!,Alright!
"Hi, yes I am. However, I think you're price is a bit much. I'd be willing to pay $198.",How about $210 and I'll deliver the mattress to you for free?
Sold!,Deal! Great working with you!
Hello,Hello
I am interested in your item for sale.,Awesome.  I have it listed for $200.
"The listing says everything is stock, but tires can't really hold up for 30 years... what condition is the rest of the bike in?",The bike is in great condition.  It was my aunt's bike and stored in her shed.  It does not look like she rode it at all.
Alright. Would you negotiate on the price at all?,What were you thinking?
I was thinking around $100 since it is so old.,I could do $150 and deliver it to you.
"Oh wow, that's really generous, I was thinking I would have to come pick it up.",So we have a deal $150 and I will deliver.
I'm looking for a router.,Hi  Are you interested in my wireless router.
I think I might be. Can you tell me more about it?,It is still in great condition and ive used it for my office but it can be used at home as well
I would offer you $35 for it.,I could come down to 50 and help you with installation.
"That's pretty good. Could you include the ethernet cables, too?",Everything comes with it and everythings still in great condition.
It looks nice. What was the original price you posted on the ad?,"I'm asking $3,500. The car was just registered for this month"
It looks nice. I can offer you about $1800,I don't know. That's about half what I'm asking.
And how about $2200. I can come get it today and pay cash!,"$2,500 and you have a deal"
Hi! Do you have the picture of the speaker?,"Yeah! Here it is. As you can see, the speaker is in the original packaging and hasn't been opened or used."
Cool.. Does it works great?,"Yeah, its brand new and works well"
How about $10?,"I'd be willing to go down to $15, but no lower."
Not even $13?,$14?
Hello!,hello
How are you?,good how are you. Are you interested in the ottoman?
"I'm great.  And yes I am, if you could tell me more about it",It was barely used and in very good condition. The fabric is very thick and great quality. It is not being used at the moment
Really?  That's great to hear.  Could I pick it up today if I pay cash?,Yes it is available for pick up today. Price is $150.
"I would like to pay $110, please",I don't think I can go that low on it. It was originally purchased for $250 and has barely been used.
"Really?  That's good to hear, but it is still second hand.  $130?",I would be happy with $135 if that works for you.
Ah that would be acceptable.  Can I pick it up now?,Yes! Thank you
"Hi, how are you?","Hi, doing great! Hope you are well today!"
"Thank, I'm interested in your phone. Can I ask how old it is?",The phone is about a year old.
Sounds good. Do you know if it has ever been submerged in water?,It has not had any water damage at all. The phone is in like new condition.
"Okay, I would like to offer $54.",I am really hoping to get the full $60 but I can do $54 if you are willing to pick up the item.
"Sounds great, I can do that!",Wonderful! We have a deal!
"nice car, is there anything original on it?",Yes the body is steel and the fenders and hood which are all original
"Ah I see, so the work is more about the interior. Can do you do 12000?","I think that is slightly low for all the work and considering the rarity, how about 1350?"
"It is rare, but the work done devalued some of that novelty to be honest, 13000","I find that a little off putting, but in any case I think 1300 will work since i need to get it sold"
I'm interested in your bike. Can you tell me anything about how long you've had this?,"Hi. I have had this bike for about one year, and its of great quality and in an excellent condition."
I like it. I really do. But the asking price is up in the clouds. There are many of these bikes in similar condition as low as 650. You even admit in your ad that it's hard to tell what's been remade and what parts are original on this bike. I can afford something closer to the 760 dollar range.,"Well, I could give it to you for $760 provided you come and get it yourself. Does that seem fair?"
I noticed this is from 2010. Would you nor willing to take 550?,"I wish i could, but it's pretty much brand new. How about 650?"
I have 630 to spend. I can pickup today.,630 it is
Hello anyone there?,i'm sorry

Is it lightweight?,"yes bought it for my wife and she ended up not using it, so here am, it's been stored in the garage so it's well kept for and i'ts like new"
What is the least you will accept for it?,i would be willing to lower the price to $175 if you can pick it up.

I'm looking for $175 but all the upgrades come with it."
"Sweet. Sounds really nice, I definitely want to hop on this deal. Could you do $150 and I'll come over and pick it up from your place?",I could do $150 and you pick it up.

I've been looking for a Digital Oscilloscope! How long have you had this one for? Why have you decided to sell it?,"I've only had it for a couple months.  I figured it would get a lot of use, but it's pretty much sat on a shelf.  It's only been used a couple times.  I'm looking for 490 for it.  I think that's fair as I'm including a 17 inch LCD monitor and two 150MHz probes.  Is this your first Oscilloscope or have you been using one for a while?"
"It's my first. I've used them in the past, but I've never owned one. They're a bit out of my budget! However, I'm very interested in this one.

It has a 100 Mega Samples a sec and can export data to PCs.  It even has internal storage.  What do you think is fair?"
I was hoping I could get it for $345. I can assure you it'll be put to good use!,Hmmm I can't go that low unfortunately.  You said this is your first one.  How about we go 440 and I can spend a couple hours showing you how to use it and can even throw in some replacement parts I have.
I understand. How about $400? That's about all I can afford at this time.,Do you have an old fishing pole or skis that you don't use any more?  I'm looking for one and would be willing to do 400 if you have something like that I could spend the season using.
"Yes! I can spare a fishing pole. So, $400 plus a fishing pole?",400 and a fishing pole sounds great!
Hello! I saw the bike you had for sale and was wondering what condition it was in? Are the tires in good shape?,It is in excellent shape. Looks brand new. The tires are great. I replaced them a few months ago.
"I saw a similar bike just recently, it was priced a little lower, but was wondering if you would be willing to come down a bit. I prefer the color of yours. I was hoping to do somewhere around $400?",This bike is in great shape. Has been maintained the whole time I have had it. I could do $550.
"I'm so sorry. $550 is just a little too much. I could probably come up to $450, and bring cash today.",If you can pick it up today with cash I will give it to you for $500.
Okay sounds good. Thank you!,Great!
"hey nice sub you've got for sale, is it still available?",yes

I am on a budget but my son wants this bike so much for his birthday would you be willing to take 115?,I could take $120 and deliver it to you. Would that work for you?
"Hi there! I'm great, how are you? I'm really interested in the rug you have for sale? Does it have any stains on it or any pet hair?","Im good, this rug is almost new. No tears rips stains or pet hair. It's a great rug it just doesn't match my room anymore. I'm asking $40 for it."
"OK great! I really like this rug, but I'm kinda short of cash right now. Is there any way I can get you to come down to $25 if I pick it up today?",I can come down a little but not that low. If you pick it up today and pay in cash I'll let it go for $30.
"Hey there, I'm interested in the shelf.  I'm on a bit of a tight budget, would you be willing to drop the price?","hi, it's a nice shelf, decent condition.. how about 60?"
"Your list price is $50, I was thinking $30",30 is too low... i think 50 is a fair price.. it's not big bucks
"Let's meet in the middle, $40 seems fair, no?","it's ikea... let's do 45, i will drop it off"

What can I use this for?,This is a really great vehicle for a leisurly evening ride.  Especially if you have a park where you live.
You think I can use this for joyriding with the kids and is there anything else I should know about this bike.,"The bike new and would be a nice way to spend time with the kids.  They can burn off some extra eneryg, while you enjoy a great, relaxing ride."
I want it but for $1000 does that sound reasonable. Its already in your possesion and do not want to just sit around.,"I can do $1,000.  I think you'll be really happy with it.  :)"
Hi is the apartment still avaible?,"Yes it is! Are you interested? Its $2471, everything is included like laundry, trash, pool, dishwasher, oven, microwave, etc."
Yes I'm actually very interested! The description sounds great. Is parking available at the complex?,Yes it is!

"$2,000 sounds very reasonable! Thank you so much. Cannot wait to move in",Okay thanks a lot! Enjoy your place!!
HI! Yes I'd love to buy a couch like this. Seems to be a great deal too! Is it clean and in decent condition?,"Awesome, and its in pretty good condition. A little wear and tare but other than that its a fine piece of furniture"

Well at 130k miles and being from 1999 I feel that 2500 sounds a bit better,"I wasn't willing to go that low.  I did install a new cd player with bluetooth, a dvd player and it has HID headlings."
"Well, I'm not interested in a cd player with bluetooth, I'm trying to find something that will get me from point A to point B. How about this 2750 and I'll pay for the transfer of title along with coming and picking it up.",Tell you what.  Make it 3000 out the door and you've got yourself a deal.

Hello,HI
Based on mileage I'd like to offer $3900 for this truck. I can also pick up.,"That's a bit too low, it only had one owner and is still in good condition and well maintained. I could do $5900"
Can you do 5000 if i pick up?,Yes
possibly but I am not completely sure if it would go with my kitchen or dining room furniture.,What style of furniture do you have? I have several different styles of furniture in my home and this seems to go well with all of it.
how about $250 and I will pick it up?    I can fit it in someplace,"Ok I think that is fair, It has a lot of storage space but does not take up too much room, it is a beautiful old antique chest, I think you will love it!"

"That is funny, because the original list price is only 2480.","Yeah that's for rent to own, but you have to rent it to own it"
"I understand that. So if I wanted to do rent to own and I could set up a direct deposit, how about 1800 a month?",That's already low can you afford 2 grand
I'll split it at 1900. Is that enough?,Makes me think you won't be able to pay rent u low ballin
"That will not be a issue. I said we could set it up as a direct deposit, so obviously I am not worried about having the money. 1950 is my final offer.",Okay I can agree on 1950 if you can find me a way besides Direct deposit that you can prove to me you'll be able to make rent every month
I'll get you a copy of my pay stubs. You will see how much I make.,How much u make a month? How long you been working and how much are your expenses every month?

"Well since they have broken glass and I would need to get that repaired and you are not sure how old they are, would you be willing to do $35 and I will pick them up?",How about $38 and you pick them up?
Well I would be coming more then 10 miles to get them so is there any way you could do the $35 considering all this plus it is going to be a cost to get these fixed as well.,"OK. You pick them up, bring the phone for trade, and I'll give you $35."
Hey do you still have the phone?,I do still have the phone for sale!

What is your asking price?,"$80 is a price that is fair and reasonable as I paid quite a bit more for this ruffled lamp. It's stylish, functional and a great deal"
I would be interested at a slightly lower price. I would be happy to come and pick up this item from a place most convenient for you for a small discount of 7 dollars.,"I can drop 5 dollars, not a whole 7. I think if I sit on this longer I could probably get my full asking price so if you wanna do a 5 dollar discount we can, otherwise, no."
That's a hard bargain. So are you saying you're willing to do a price of $75 on the condition I come to you to pick it up?,Exactly. Is $75 good?
"Hello. Yeah, I don't like those scratches though",Neither do I. Give me three bucks and call it even. I can't justify having you pay 5 with them being marked up like that
"Okay, but will you throw in the cat also?",You want the cat? Take her jesus she scratches everything I don't understand it. I'll even put a bird on it if you want
"hi, how are you?",im great! yourself?
I am very well. I am interested in this property. I was wondering if there is a way to go down on the monthly price? I have quite a bit of money saved right now that I could put down as a deposit if that could help lower the monthly payments.,I understand the situation. Hows your proof of employment. Have you been at the job more than 1 year?
I have been at my job for 5 years! I am a registered nurse,"If thats the case and paperwork backs it up id be willing to go as low as 2,190. Again, this neighborhood is great, Crime rate is extremely low, and of course, the place itself is lavish to say the least."
Hello are you still selling the drone?,"Yes I am.  It is basically brand new.  I just had to have one of these things and then once I bought it I was not all that impressed.  Don't really see a point myself.  It is almost brand new, just sitting in my garage collecting dust."
"That's good, does it come with anything?","Yes it comes with a ton of stuff.  There is a charger, cables, extra props, a wheeled case, just to name a few.  Oh also have a couple of skins for it that I never used and it does have a 4 year protection plan with 3 years left on it."
"Wow okay cool, well I'm really interested but I think I can only come up with about 500, is there any way you can come down on the price at all?",I can't go that low I have almost $1500 invested in this thing.  I could maybe knock 50 off.  So could you do $700 I will even bring it too you.
"Okay maybe I can come up with like 675, if you throw in the skins. How about that?",I can do that. Thank You I hope you enjoy it more than I did.
"Hi there, can you tell me is this from a smoke free home?","I've never smoked a single cigarette in my entire life, so I can safely say it's smoke free."
"Nice, and good to know.","The wear on this isn't like garish scratches, just light discoloration - I think it makes it look a bit homely, personally."
hmm. I like it still but is it the original varnish?,"Yes, I've never altered it in any way"
"okay sounds good, could you take $490?",I can't go lower than at least $510
can we meet at $500?,I suppose that'll do.
"Yes, it looks very nice. What kind of amenities does your studio have?","The apartment has an open floor plan and you also have access to the fitness center, 2 pools, and a hot tub.  It's also a convenient locations"
That sounds amazing. The asking price is a little above my budget. I have amazing credit and have never missed a payment. I can afford to pay $1200 for the studio.,"Ok I'll have to run your credit, but if it as good as you say it is then we have a deal"
Hello! I'm interested in buying your car.,"hi, do you have any questions?"
"Yes, I do. Are there any problems with the car that maybe weren't listed that I should know about?","no, it is still quite new and in great condition"
"And it gets good gas mileage, correct?","yes, it gets well above average gas mileage"
Sounds great. I can afford to buy it for around $10000. Is that reasonable for you?,"that's a little too low for me.  I'll split the difference with you and accept 11,500"
I am interest in an apartment that I can buy for a reasonable amount that is close to town and I might be interested.,Well this is what you're looking for.
Can you tell me what makes it energy efficient?,We have recently installed energy efficient wash/dryers in unit that use half the power of conventional units. Also we have multiple choices of energy sources for your convenience.
How big is the bathroom?,They are a typical 8x8 tub/toilet/sink.
"What does the kitchen have in it? Just the usual dishwasher, refrigerator, stove, and microwave?","Yes, but there is also a bar attachment with over track lighting."
Ok. How reliable is the internet access?,We have contracts through all major providers so as high as you can get; while for common areas we have a commercial grade service 2000bps.
I am interested in making an offer. Is the $1860 price negotiable?,"We do offer a slight discount for long term rentals. 12/months is the typical at 1750; however, if you need something longer we have a 5/year contract at 1500 per month."
Is there a way I can do a 5/year contract for $1200?,"Unfortunately no, the 1500 price is based on convenience of rentals. The 1860 is for a rental for 3 or less months for refurbishment between renters."
Hello,Hello. What are you looking for?
"I am looking for a studio, what's the price please?",$2172.
"Hmm, I was expecting something less than that. Are utilities included?",Yes they are. I am willing to negotiate. What else would you like to ask?
"I am new in the area, are you close to city center?",Yes we are just 5 miles from there. We have beautiful walkways to that lead out toward the city center.
"Oh, 5 miles is too far to walk for my job. Is it a gated community?",Yes it is a gated community and dogs and cats are allowed. But there is a bus that runs every day that is free for residents.
"Ok, do you need a deposit too?",No deposit. What would you like to offer?
"Hey, nice looking bike. WHy are you getting rid of it?","Well, I just recently moved and I simply don't have time to ride anymore. Sure I'll put on weight and it might ruin my love life but I have a business to run and children to feed."
Hahaha,I'm asking a list price of 1800 which is a discount from the retail original price. As you can see I've added a few upgrades to the bike as well.
"Yeah, I honestly was looking at something that hadn't been ridden for a whole season. Your price is quite high for me at this point.",Well what kind of price range works for you? Let's see if we can find a price we both like.
Hi. Are you interested in apartment?,"I'm interested in finding a tenant for the apartment, are you interested in it?"
Hi. Yes. Thank you. I am interested in your apartment. Is heat included?,"No, but I do pay water and garbage.  You'll need to furnish your electric"
Is there carpeting or wood floors?,It has wood floors throughout but carpeting in the bedrooms.  There is an electric heat pump that works great
Okay. About the heat? How much is a typical heating bill during the winter months for this space?,"It will depend on your use but I'd say 80-110 is average, bearing in mind it's a large townhome"
Okay. I was looking at a townhome a few blocks away. They offer free heat and have a big bath with jacuzzi jets. What kind of tub or shower does your place have?,It has a very nice garden tub and shower upstairs and then a half bath downstairs.  Both are newly updated and have new tiles and flooring
I noticed that you are located by a drug-testing facility for recently that is frequented by people on probation and parolees. I am very concerned about that.,"Yes I understand that, but we do have a security system in place in the unit that you can activate for a small monthly fee.  I'm asking $1800 for the apartment but I can do $1700 to adjust for the heating cost if that would suit you"
I am willing to offer you $1500. I think that is a fair price for the location,"Okay, I will accept that offer."
Excellent. See you later.,Thank you!
"Hello, I am interested in this tv. How old is it?",It is pretty much new. I got it about two months ago and it is in perfect condition.
Does it come with all the cables and paperwork?,Yes it does.
"Okay, great! I am very interested in it. Are you willing to come down any on the price? I would be willing to meet today with cash in hand.","Yes, sure. How much are you hoping to spend on it?"
I was hoping to not go over $800.,"Hey, that is fine by me. I am willing to give it to you for 800 dollars."
"Hi, I am very interested in this item. Is it in good shape?","Hello. Yes, it is in very good condition."
Can I stop by and have a look at it? I am in the market for a new car.,"Absolutely, we can arrange that tonight if you'd like. It has very few miles on it and a Car Fax report is available."
Great. Are you willing to lower the price on it? I do not think I can afford over 8000 dollars for a car.,I could probably negotiate on the price but not too much. Honda Accords retain their resale value and this one is in good condition with few miles.
How about 6000 dollars for it? That seems fair to me.,No that would be a huge price cut and you haven't really offered any justification for such a price cut. Blue Book value of this car is right in line with what I have it listed for.
I'm interested in purchasing the sub box.,Sure!
What's the best price you can give me for it?,I am taking it out for $50. I can give it to you for $45. This costed me more than what I expected to be made. They're custom molded around the latch and the inside of the tailgate. The box is going to fit in most vehicles universally.
How about $20?,That's too low. The last I can do is $40
$25?,I can do $40 last
$30?,$40 is last
I'll have to think about it some more then.,"Tell you what, I can give it to you for $35 but then you will have to come pick it up! I wouldn't be able to deliver it ti you."
Wow! This looks great!,It really is a great washing machine.  Are you interested in it?
is there 25 lights in tubes,"Correct, there are 25 lights on offer here. They have never been used and still have the one year warranty in tact. For reference, they are 18W G13 120cm 4ft 48"" 6500K Cool White t* LED tube lights 110V. The length of each is 1200mm or 47.2 inches."
i would love to pay 150.00 dollas,"Considering that these are brand new, never used lights, I am asking $200"
there are many but i only need a couple what about 150.99,Way too low. These are brand new lights. Why would I go that low?
to sell them to a buying custome 151.00,"I'll tell you what. If you come pick them up where they are located, I'll sell them for $190"
"Hi there, West Oakland is really dangerous, but I need a new place for my friends and I.","Great. Well, this is a great place for you. This place is very nice."
"Cool, We each have about 500 each, theres five of us that's like 2500",That is a bit low. How about 3300? That is almost 400 less than what I was asking originally.
"Ummm that's like 660 each, uh can we do 650 times 5? It's easier for everybody to understand for some reason, like 3250?",I could work with that. 3250 nounds good. You got a deal my friend.
"Hi, I'm interested in the car for sale?",$25K car on sale in excellent condition going for $6415 come and get it while its hot!!

"Ouch. Please I really need a car so I can go to work, but all I have is 6000, any more and I won't be able to feed my children. All 12 of them.","This car will last you and your kids all your lives. You will be able to hand it down to your kids and your kids kids. And they'll be able to ride on it. Its like new, $6400 is my bottom dollar."
yes I am how much are you asking for it?,I would honestly love to get $7000 for the car but I'm willing to bargain.
Has the bike been used a lot?,"no, it's fairly new!"
"Okay, well 150 is out of my budget. Are you willing to go lower?","Sure, a little. What would you like to offer? It's a great bike, and well worth the money."
Would you accept 110?,I can do $125. Would that work for you?
"Hello, how are you?","I'm great, hope you are as well."
"I am, thank you.  Can you tell me a little about the use of this vehicle?  Highway or local driving?  Does the current owner have children or pets?","Yes, I sure can. I'm selling a 2008 Toyota Prius with low miles, 44,900. It's in excellent condition. The vehicle was used on the highway but not much, just basically local. No, just children, no pets"
"That is very low mileage for the age of the vehicle?  I checked KBB and it looks like the value for this with the miles and condition is about $5,200. What is the gas mileage like?","you get 48 city/45 highway for gas mileage. However, I am willing to negotiate the price but $5,200 is too low, I'm sorry."

"Hi, is the Pleasanton 4 bedroom still available?","It sure is! It's going for $3700, has all appliances included, and the neighborhood is fantastic, even more so if you have children!"
Sounds great!  How old is the house?,"I'm not quite sure on the exact age, but its a newer build house, it has central heating and air, and large double pane windows, plus a large back patio, so its not too dated at all."
Cool.  Do you allow pets?,"Yes pets are allowed, the backyard would be great for a dog!"
Wonderful.  Is the 3700 firm?,"We can go to $3500 but not any lower as the location is so nice, plus the yard is maintained by gardners. So is it a deal?"
"Hi, I am very interested in renting your beautiful home. How many bathrooms?",There are two full bathrooms.
"Okay, great. While it is a beautiful home, the price is a bit high for me. Would it be possible to take 2700?",We can work with you on the price a little bit if you have a good credit history.

"Ok, deal!",Great!

"That's too much and I can't afford that, but before we get down to the price as mentioned in the listing the sofa was from Costco. Would you happen to have any warranty with it?","no, there's no warranty"
"Okay good to know that, and is the sofa black or brown?",it's dark brown.  $100 and you can have it

Hi! I'm interested in your cabinet but the 'structurally sound' condition doesn't sound too promising. Is it in pretty rough shape?,"No that just means it is in good shape. You can shake it pretty well and it won't break. It is nice. If you want it, and I deliver it to your place personally, would you be willing to give me $40 for it?"

Sorry! No deal,"I think it's a great deal. $30 is my lowest, but that's it."

Wow that's a long time. May I ask why didn't you use it? Does it work well or are there any malfunctions associated?,Well I love the bike but I had been riding cross country on an endurance bike. So this has been fairly unused. No malfunctions I had made sure to periodically spray it with anti rust and anti seeze. Also it was left in a dry and secure environment.
"Okay that's good ti know. However, the price is very high for me. Is there anyway that we can work on that?",Yes but Id prefer to not go too low as I said before I love the bike and I am reluctuant to sell. Mainly selling due to me down sizing and lack of use.
I can offer $390 as its old and has been sitting. Would appreciate it if you consider it,390 is a bit harsh on me. Tell you what I can add a free delivery and a standard set of maintenace equipment specific to this type of bike
What's the last price you can give me?,lets start at 550 and negotiate in increments of 10 from there?
"I can give you $500 honestly, I can't go beyond that because It doesn't fit my budget after that. ]",Ok 500 I can do and Ill also add a 1 year waranty on the chain to prove how sure I am of this bike.

Hi. These lamps are beautiful. Can you tell me more about them?,Sure! They come as a pair and are in great condition. I would say they are great for an ecletic home maybe someone looking for something vintage?

I could definetly come get them today and will pay cash. Could you do $45?,I really can't. I can go as low as 57.00. Any lower and I would be losing money.

I was wondering if it would be possible for you to meet me for a test drive,Yes. Please contact me when you are ready at the number available

Hi. I am interested in your bike. What kind of condition is it in?,Very good condition i maintained it regularly it has an aluminium frame with carbon fibre leader forks and it has barely been used so at 550 it is a steal!

Hi is the apartment still available?,"Hello, it is! Are you interested?"
Yes I am interested. I had a couple questions. What is the square footage of the place and what are the appliances like?,1200 sq ft and the appliances are in good condition. Typically I split a one time 40% rental fee with the new tenant but I'll waive that if we can agree on 1775 per month?

Hey there. is the backup camera useful to you?,"This was my first car with a camera in it. I don't think I'll ever buy another car without it. When you get it, you think ""I'll never use that"" but then you come to rely on it more and more."

that's right around the average for about 4 year old car.. Tell you what? I like the car so i,Yes?

6000 it is then. it's a deal,Deal

"Okay, very nice. I see your asking $999 for it but I was wondering if you would let it go for $699? I'm on a strict budget at the moment.",I'm sorry but I can't go that low. Would $825 work for you?

How many miles?,"Only 5,200."
It's a nice truck.  I have 13000 in cash today,"I'm sorry, that is less than half of what I'm asking. Unless you can give me the cash + something to trade, I'll need more. I could do payments on the balance."
Well I have a 2009 Harley motorcycle that belonged to my late husband.  It's sitting in the garage collecting dust.  I'm purchasing the truck for my son.  How about 13000 plus the motorcycle?,You have a deal. That works for me!
"I want it, but not at 200.  I'd like to pay 170.",okay 190 you want?
I think 190 is a fair compromise.,lets do it
"Hello, I'm interested in the bike.",Wonderful. This is a great bike and has barely been used so it is in like new condition.
How does it hold up? Does it handle well when ridden?,Yes. It handles very well and can support up to 13 years of age.
"I'm a little worried about the stability of the tires. I know it is like new and barely used, but I'm concerned that with the tires sitting around, they may have become damaged. Would you be willing to take $60?",It is a little dirty from use a couple times but has been kept hanging inside of a shed so the tires are in very good condition. I could go as low as $80 if you were able to pick up today.
"I'm very interested in this for my daughter's birthday. I don't have a lot to spend and it sounds like I would need to clean it to get it looking nice. I plan to give this as a gift and wouldn't want it to look dirty. If I pick it up in the next hour, can we split the difference and meet at $70?",I could do that.
Yes I am. This sounds perfect but I am a little confused as to the price. Is this a rental quote?,i have a nice 4bedroom spacious apartment
I am moving to Berkeley from the midwest. Where I live this would rent for about $3000/month. You are asking $6495/month?,yes cause it's up to date with the latest in technmeras and moreology apple tv led smart tv amazon echo Security ca

I was interested in your one bedroom. What can you tell me about it?,"it's got a lot of amenities - a pool, barbecue area, on-site manager"
Sounds okay. But I was looking for a place with a gym and sauna. What is the asking price?,"it doesn't have a gym or sauna, but there is a laundry facility and it's convenient to BART; how does $1950 a month sound? that's a deal for this area"
5200,Mine is also one owner and mint. Would you consider a trade and 3500?
5100,I could do 4000
Hello!  How are you?,"great, how are you?"
Super special awesome.  That's a nice dresser you have,"Thanks, I've quite enjoyed it, unfortunately we're moving out of the country and can't take it with us"
That's a shame.  There's a night stand as well?,"Yes, both are from Crate and Barrel"
What's that?,the classiest furniture joint on the planet
Really?  I guess I'm just low class then.  I will pay you $130 if I can pick it up today,"that will all change when you get this dresser and night stand, it will literally change your socioeconomic status, I'd really like to get a little more for it, would you be able to $180?"
Well if it's for self improvement... I can go $170 then,"That seems fair if you can come get it, it's a pain strapping this thing on my moped"
How did you get it in then?,duct taped it to my moped
Hi. Is this bicycle rusty?,"Hi! How are you? The bike isn't rusty and is in great condition. However, the pedals are not included."

Thanks for that information. It puts my mind at ease. I'm definitely interested in buying the bike today.  How about 860?,"Since I want $930 (price at $20 less so you can purchase new pedals) and you want $860, how about we meet directly in the middle at $895?"
895 is a bit more than I wanted to spend and the bike is 10 years old.  How about 880 cash and I'll come pick it up today?,How about $890 and I will deliver it to you?
"Hi, I am interested in your thermostat. Is it new or has it been used?",I used it for a couple months it is in like new condition. It works perfectly.
Is it easy to use?,"Yes, it is easy to use. I don't have the box or the manual, but the manual is available online."
I have priced these and I think $39 for a used one is a little high. I would like to buy it but I think $20 seems more fair.,I can't go that low. I paid more and like I said it has barely been used. I could come down to $32
I have $27 cash on me right now and I can come get it now. Would that work for you?,I could accept that if you would come get it now with cash.
"Hey there, nice ottoman set you have here","Hi how are you, are you interested in my chair for sale? It's got some light scratches, but is in otherwise great shape. I'm asking 50 for it"
"I'd like 40, what condition is it in?","Well it has some scratches and the cushion has faded slightly. I'll take 40, I think that's reasonable."

Hello.,"Hello, Thank you for contacting me, As you can see the bike is in pretty good condition, there are a few after market parts I have added, and I will be throwing in a free bike lock."
"I'd hate to low ball you, but this is for my wife. It's her 30 birthday and she wants to lose weight and exercise. I've only got $70 and it'd mean a lot if you could lower the price.","You know what? Id be more then happy to do that for you.

I'm real interested in this bike. I have cash in hand and can pick up right away. I have $90 to offer you. Would you accept the offer?,"Sure, that actually sounds great to me. I won't be available until after five. I've got another deal to make earlier in the day. Will that be a problem?"

Nice! I would be willing to buy it for $3300 cash.,"It also has leather seats. If I deliver it, could you come up to 3500"
"I do see that you said you wanted $3700, but your ad states $3500, so i am not sure if you were trying to get more form me or not. I actually own my own truck to tow it so I do not need delivery. Since it has a sound sysytem, $3350 is what I  can do.",ok
Hi there yes I am interested. But I would like to negotiate a cheaper price if possible.,"I can go to $2500, but not any lower as there has been some fixes and new fixtures/paint etc to make it more fresh and new for the buyers"

"I see, do you think you can come down on the price, One box usually goes for $12 so I was trying to find a deal","Well they are brand new in the box still. You just don't have to stand in line, order on TV, or pay taxes to get them. What price did you have in mind?"
I was thinking somewhere from 20-25 work with me please there for my grandmothers old couch we barely use.,"I understand that probably has some sentimental value. If we can do $24, that puts you at $8 each. Fair enough?"

The original price is much higher. I just need to get rid of it that's why I offered the listing price. I can do $15 and thats only for you

"Well, it is small, but since it's only me, I think it will work. I think the rent is too high for the size of the house. Will  you consider $1500? I can pay 3 months in advance.","Are you saying $1,500 per month?"
"Yes, I checked the comps in the area and it's about the going price for the size of the house.","I really can not go that low, I would be willing to include water service and change the air filters every month for $2,000 per month."
"How about $1800. I can sign 1 year lease. It will be just me, no kids or pet. I am very clean :)",I can do that but at that price I can not do the water or filters.

Ok how about 375 for it?,im sorry that is a bit low...this sofa has a hand-built frame with hand finished upholstery
I don't have much to spend on it. How about 460. Thats as high as I can go,I really can't go that low...this brand new item would be 2x the amount that I am asking for it...how about $650 and it's yours
500 and you got a deal,I could do 525 and you come pick it up tonight
"Hey, quick question, is that TV 1080P?",I believe so.
does it come with the receiver for the speakers too?,"Yes it does, it also will come with a Blu Ray player"

How are you? I am interested in your apartment,Fine thanks for your interest the apartment is for rent 2500 a month and is a great apartment
I just got a job in the area and plan to live here at least 2 years.  I would be able to sign a 2 year lease if you can give me a better monthly price.  I also can provide great references.,I dont know how much I can do we have other people interested in moving in all the time
"Yes, but probably not two many people that could sign a lease for two years.  Thats two years that you don't have to worry about.  Can you do $1500 and I can start right away",oh no that is impossible I barely break even with the high california taxes and maintenance
"I understand.  What about $1750, remember it is 2 years stress free",I can offer you $2400 it is not much stress I usually have people moving in within 1-2 months
"Ok, I might look elsewhere than, $2000 is my max",Ok good luck then I just cant do it if I am losing money if something needs repaired in the apartment
"Ok, so 8 min lost on this hit because you won't negotiate lower.  Interesting",you can hit quit if no deal made and I am negotiating just not half off lol
I went up 500 and you went down 100.  $2200 final offer,you went up 500 from very low not impressive 2300 final offer
Hello,Hello. Are you interested in this property and are there any questions I can answer for you?
Yes please tell me about the house.,"It is a great home in a lovely neighborhood. 3 bedrooms, 1 bath, newly renovated and hardwood floors. Nothing in the area compares."
But only one bathroom....Can you take 2300,That is a very fair offer...
"Hello, I am very interested in renting this home, however I feel your asking price is a little high.","I understand, but it is such a great apartment! You have access to a pool, fitness, center and even a free shuttle!"
"I certainly agree it has many perks, however when looking at real estate in the area your asking price is more in line with high end luxury homes, and while the home is very nice I believe around 1800$ would be more reasonable.","Well, I tell you what, I am willing to go down on my price to $2000. How does that sound?"
Hello,"If you are interested in the apartment, I would be willing to let you move in with no deposit for a monthly rent of $2450.  Would that work for you?"
"No, I don't think so.  How about $1700?","We normally charge one month's rent to move in, but since you want a lower price, I can offer you free access to the workout room for rent of $2200.  Does that work for you?"
"No, I appreciate the offer, but I don't think $2200 is acceptable.  I like the laundry convenience, so how about $1725?","Okay, I can do $1800 if you are willing to sign a 3-year rental agreement.  Does that work for you?"
I think that would be doable.  $1800 it is!,"Perfect, so our final price is $1800 with a 3-year rental agreement.  Thanks!"

I don't think I could come up with $700 right now. If I come by in a couple days I might have $650.,If you could come up with 675 i could hold it for a couple days for you
"Hi there, I am interested in the dresser you have for sale. Do the drawers ""stick"" or have a hard time opening and closing?",No not at all...it has some minor issues cosmetically but they are indeed very minor...I have plans to remedy the ring on top of the dresser but if you are willing to do it yourself I will negotiate with you fairly and justly.
I do like the piece! However I am on a budget. Would you be able to do $400 and deliver?,That sounds very reasonable...are you going to fix the ring in this price or is that something that would need to be completed before delivery?
If you are willing to fix it I would appreciate it.,Ok submit your final offer...I will fix the ring and deliver if the price is right and what you stated it to be.
"Good morning, so I'm interested in your sub and amplifier.",It's a great set.  I am the original owner and am only getting rid of them because I bought a newer set of speakers.
Is there anything wrong with them?,No.  Just had an opportunity to purchase a newer set and didn't need both.
"Ok, so I can do $60, unless you throw some extras in/",I have a set of connecting cables that will run between the amp and the speakers.  Those are new.  I'm willing to deliver them to you as well.  No less than $80.
Hello. I'm interested in buying the chairs. Are they in great condition?,As you can see in the picture they are in excellent condition. They were originally used in my dinning room which was rarely used.

Hi,Would you like to make an offer...
"yes, did you need my phone number or can we just deal with it here?",Well that is a very good question...

Coudl you do $15?,"Yes, 15 is a very reasonable offer, I can accept that."
Yes does this mean there is no deposit and 1000 comes off my first month of rent?,That is correct. No deposit and $1000 off first months rent. Does this sound like a great deal?

Hi im interested in your home is it pet friendly,"Unfortunately it is not. There's no pets allowed on this listing. I'm really sorry, it's not my choice."
Thats ok i would be willing to pay 1500 per month and sign a 1 year lease,"I can't go that low. If you have good credit I could knock some off the down payment. Still we'd have to meet in the middle. I can't go below 2,000 a month."
Would be willing to pay for my credit check it is very good and i could do 2000 per month,Yeah that sounds great.
My granddaughter would like this little bike. Will you take $18 for it?,"Sorry, the bike is in really good condition. I would consider $30"

I am interested. It is 2 years old though. Would you be willing to come down in the price?,"The phone is like new, so I could come down a bit but not much.  I have several other interested parties."
"Yes, I understand. I have been looking at other listings as well. I could do $140 and I would pick it up today with cash in hand.",I can't go lower than $170.  Did I mention it does have an extended warranty that would give you warranty coverage for another full year.
Could you do $165?,"If you pick it up with cash today, I could do $165."

"Hey, I'm interested in the house bu there seems to be some issues.",What issues do you have?

"So due to all these problems, I'll have to ask you to come down to 1600.",I will not be able to bring it down that much
Well can you install a wheelchair ramp?,"We can install a wheelchair ramp, for sure, to ensure both the front and back entrances are wheelchair accessible"
"Okay, so can you come down to $1900?",That would still be cutting the price in half; can't bring it down that much. The lowest we can bring it down to is $3000
"I can do $2600 but not any more, sorry.",We can make $2600 work
What can you tell me about it besides what I read in the ad?,"$100. I put a lot of elbow grease into this table. It is 50 years old and very sturdy. It is a good representation of mid-century American furniture. I am very proud of the work I put into it, but I no longer have the room for it."
It's a great table from what I can see.  Would you be willing to take $90?  I can pick it up today and pay in cash.,"Reluctanly yes, I will accept that offer."

And this place is in fact one of the nicer places around the location. You will love this place, the inside is so nice, new, and fresh. We are asking for $2480 for it."
That's a great location. My budget is very limited however. Is there any way you could come down on the price?,"Yes we can. We can come down to $2000 and you will need to arrange your own move, we will not provide movers."

You'll have to deal with your condition on your own, but there is no more pollen here than anywhere else in Berkeley. and all utilies AND internet is included. all you do is pay rent and you're done for the month."
Hmm you make a good point here my friend.  So are you able to help me out and to lower the cost for my budget at all of 1200?,"1200 is a bit too low, tell you what, if you sign a 2 year lease, i can give it to you for 1300 a month"

The highest I can go is 13,I will let you have it for $13
Thank you.,You're welcome.
This looks amazing! Is it cable ready?,Of course.  It has everything you can imagine!
Is there a pool in the area?,Of course.  It's in Berkley's colorful community!

"Okay, what about the price? Can we negotiate the price because its too expensive for me.",I'm asking $250 because it was recently painted and has been kept in pristine condition. I'm willing to negotiate a little but I don't have much wiggle room.
$250 is a huge amount which I at this point cannot afford nor does it fit my budget.,What about $235? You also have to remember you're getting the headset in addition to such a great bike.
I can give $125. You can remove the headset if it even matters?,That barely covers the paint job. How about $250 and I throw in a helmet and knee pads that I won't be using.
I cannot go beyond $150.,"I'm sorry about the last offer. I meant to say $200. But that's the lowest I can go. If that won't work for you, I'll have to move on to other interested parties."
How about $180 and I can come get it from you right away?,Ok. for $180 that would work.
Yes,"So what do you think of the price? Honestly I'm quite low-balling it here, it's a vintage classic, but I need the space!"
What's the lowest u can go,I could drop about 10%. How does $3105 sound?
Is there anything wrong with it,"The body is antique, but solid metal so no issues. The rest is practically new, and it rides like a beauty."
Do you accept trades,"I'm looking for cash only, unfortunately. Just making space."
Will you accept 2622,I can't drop that low unfortunately.
Is there any extras that come with it,"Nope, I'm just selling the bike, though it is autographed by the 1990 Russian Olympic Team. Will you do $3100?"
Can you do 2900,"I can do $3000, let's split it down the middle, shall we?"
Sure,"Great, sending my offer. Enjoy your day! I'll get back to my Turkey."
Is this table clean or does it have scratches.,"It has normal wear on it, but it is still ingood shape. The legs may have a small scratch but nothing to deep. The glass is smoked and looks like new."

What color is the case?,"Black and blue, silicone case with a hard shell and raised corners for extra protections"

"Interesting. Well, I was looking for something cheaper at about $5600, but I maybe able to go a little higher if there is a warranty on the truck",Unfortunately there is no warranty on the truck. I was looking for 7800. Maybe we can meet somewhere in the middle? It does have leather heated sets.

Sounds good. Would you be willing to pay for a background check if I make you an acceptable offer>,I have a Carfax report for it in my possession if that is what you are speaking of.
"Yes, that's right. I recently saw a similar model at a dealership for about 30,000 but yours looks better maintained, so I'm happy to make a higher offer for your car. How does 31,500 sound?","According to Kelly Blue Book value, I have this car priced very close to the value.  Given the pristine condition, year, miles, etc. $31,500 is very low.  I will accept $43,000.  Even at this price, you are getting an awesome deal!"
"What if I pick up the car myself? Could you do 35,000?","Sorry, can't do it."
hello,Hi just one owner on this fully loaded car. Great for commuting to work and features to talk someone into car pooling.
"Nice, I'll give you 10k cash",Considering the year and features that is just too low. Can you do better than that?
12k is the Kelly Blue Book value so i'm gonna have to stop there,If you can go 15000 I can throw in accessories such as free tinting already paid for at a insured shop along with detailing for a year membership I already paid for.
This is a beautiful set. I think this would look good as far as the picture goes. I am going for the same setup,Free delivery
Would you be willing to accept a lower price for it?,75 is the rock bottom price
please reconsider if possible,70 final offer
okay so I will get this set for $70 and free delivery right?,70 without delivery. 75 with delivery
Hi I am very interested what kind of shape is it in,"It's in great shape, gently used and has a small issue on the right arm rest but not really noticeable"
Well I would really like it but right now I am afraid I can only afford 200 I just lost everything I own to a house fire and have nothing.,sorry to hear about that. I really do understand. I would be willing to accept $350
I am but not for 45,"i would take 35 but, no lower"
What about if I could be there in an hour with the cash??,35 would still be my lowest. i bought this for well over 35.
I guess it is worth it. Ill take it,okay awesome just give me your phone number so i can send you address details
916-555-2223,great! we have a deal i will be texting you from 916-555-6543
i am very interested in renting your home. the only thing i would like to ask is if you could come down $2700? i would be willing to take care of all outside landlord related maintenance like the lawn in such for you,"Hmm, I was expecting to remain at $3200 firm BUT if you would do all the yard maintenance and gardening, I have lots of rose bushes that need care,  I think I can come down on the price. I will expect you to sign a 2 year lease for $2700 though."
i think a two year lease for $2700 sounds completely fair.,"Good, come on down and we will get all the paperwork checked out and settled."
hi I saw your ad is the bike still for sale?,"Yep, waiting for a good home"
how much damage does it have?,It's not damaged
Hello I'm interested in the town home you have listed,"yeah, it's in a nice area, recently rennovated. gorgeous inside"
I can pay about 1250.,ouch. that's very low for home this size and given all the amenities.
can you negotiate a lower price?,i guess i can give it to you for 2100 if you sign a 1 year lease
That's kind of out of my affordable range. The most I could do is probably 1650,"Yeah that's not going to work. Tell you what, if you do 3 year lease, i can do 1900 a month"
I'll sign the lease today if you can do 1800,1800... that will require a 4 year lease. and every year the home will have to be inspected and you will have to pay for any repairs or cleaning that's needed.
I accept.,ok that's a deal
i have no clue what this does but i have to own it.,"It is in great shape, I am asking $750."
it looks beautiful. what do i use it for/,It is a sound mixer.
oh that's nice. i need a sound mixer. the mixer i have is a little crazy. i was thinking 650 though,How about we meet in the middle at $700.
Hey!,hi
"Let's cut to the chase, your goodies, I want them. But, we can't ignore that fact they have some miles on them so let's negotiate. I'm thinking $165.",$165 and you pick them up
"When I pick them up, will you shake my hand?",thanks
Hi. I'm interested in your timer for sale. What'd you pay?,I am looking at a sell price of 5.00
I only have $4. Would that work? I could come pick it up.,I will accept 4.00  Can you pick up at #164 W. Jackson Street & cypress ave.  it's the corner of walgreen pharmacy parking lot.
That works. I can be there in 1 hour!,that works great.  I will see you in 1 hour.
I am very interested in your listing. Is it still available?,Yes it is. It is 2250 a month with a year lease and you get 1 month off move in with the lease.
That is a bit out of my comfort zone financially. Are the appliances included as well?,"Yes they are. Cats are allowed with extra deposit , dogs aren't"
I see. Would you be willing to take 1500/mo for the unit?,That is a bit too low. How about 2000 a month?
1750? Is there a deposit?,No there isn't but that is why I have a lease. How about 1850?
Ok 1850 sounds reasonable,Ok great
HI I am interested in your hutch is it still available?,Yes. We are eager to sell. Only $1000.
"I can't really tell, what is the top made of?",The counter top is decorative glass.
Nice is it new or used?,"It's in ""like new"" condition. It's a showroom piece."
Ok I am very interested but $1000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to take $800 for it?  I can pick it up right away.,I'll let it go for $900. This is a beautiful piece.
Could we meet in the middle at $850?,You seem like a nice guy. You have a deal.
"I am, how much is a 2 bedroom, the ad doesn't specify bedrooms available",our ad is actually the price for a 2 bedroom! it is 979
"Oh I see, and how much is a 1 bedroom?",We only have 2 and 3 bedrooms available!
"That's too bad, I'm on a tight budget.  Would you be willing to accept me for $600 per month?","There is unfortunately no way for me to lower the price that low but, what I can do for you is waive the pet deposit and give you 3 visits free to our pet spa. You can also save money by cancelling your gym membership since we have one on-site included in your monthly rent!"
I would like to know the condition of this chair,It has two rough patches on it about the size of a nickel on the front two edges and it squeaks just a little as you stand up but it is in good condition.
Would you accept $9 cash for it since it squeaks?,Yes $9 and I will throw in a computer mouse.
Hello there.,"Hello! How are you doing today? I am very much interested in purchasing your bed. Can you tell me about it, does it have any stains, tears or weird odors?"
"I'm interested in the mattres if it's still for sale,",Yes it's still for sale. Me and my girlfriend are in the process of moving so we're just trying to get rid of it.
"Gotcha, so I see that it's a full, does it have any tears or stains?",It does have a few minor stain but nothing really noticeable. Plus the sheets will cover anything up.
Ok well my current bed got infested with bed bugs so I'm in dire need of a new mattress. If I offer you $15 can I come pick it up today?,Bed bugs are horrible but yeah I can accept $15 just to help you out. I know how bad bed bugs can be.
Hello. Is there a pool on the property?,Sorry there is no pool but this is a good house in a very good location and the price is reasonable.
The price seems really steep for 3 bedrooms. Are the schools good and are there a lot of children in the neighborhood?,The price might seem high but that's really the market value in this area for a single-family house of this size
Are the appliances included and is it an upgraded kitchen?,Yes and comes with appliances which are new because it has been recently remodeled.
The most I could really do is $1600,I can go down to 2700
Morning.,What would you like to offer for the shelves?
I'd like to know what type of wood it is?,rich mahogany
How old is the unit?,The unit is about 5 years old.
Is it handmade or store bought?,I bought it from Furniture Store INC.
Are there visible imperfections?,Nope! The unit is in great shape.
Ok.  I'll offer $35 for it.,"How about $37, and I'll deliver it to you directly?"
"Hello, I am very interested in this listing","Hello sure I have a great 2 bedroom, 2 bath apartment listed. It is gorgeous!"
Are you willing to negotiate the price at all? My budget is sort of tight and I am able to pay 2062 currently.,I completely understand. I would like to come up a little just to 2100. Is that possible?
That would be great!,Excellent!
"Hello, I just saw your Marinoni for sale.",Are you interested? It is in great condition! It has been very well maintained and features TWO water bottle cages. A rare find on a bike like this!
"Sounds like it, I have been looking for this exact one. $1100 seems a bit high, the last one went for a bit less. I was wondering if you'd be willing to go lower, around $600 to $650?","I couldn't possibly go that low! Marinoni Ciclo T-3s are in high demand right now, especially a 10-speed like this one! I was thinking around $950 would be fair."
"How about $900, and i'll come pick it up?",Deal!
"Hello, is this apartment still available?","Yes, it is still available.  We are asking 2311.  This includes the apartment as well as access to the community amenities."
yes,Great. I'm selling for $75 each. I have 5 left. How many did you want?
Just need one but can't spend too much,Oh ok. What were you looking to spend?
I would like to stay in the $35-$40 range,I can't go quite that low. These are high quality chairs. I could do 65
Hmmm...well I'm the potential buyer,"Yes, that's what I'd like. $20 and whiskey! Or feel free to subtract the whiskey and add cash."
"Hi, it is an awesome bike",The seat is padded and after long rides it makes the user tingle pleasantly. I'm asking $175 for it.
That is a little bit high for me. I can go up to $150 on this one,"I understand, but, check out the upgraded wheels on this mother!  How about $169?"
"wow, yes those wheels are great. can we agree to find an in between? lets say $157 right now?",Sounds good!
"Hello, I'm going to just get to it. I am interested in your Sierra but in order for me to get it to the point I need it I have to ask if it is at all possible to have at 4000? That's all in cash and can pick it up as soon as possible.",That's an interesting offer. If you can do 4500 then we have a deal.
I can do 4250. Would that work for you?,How about 4350? I feel like we're really getting close here.
HI would you take 90? that is 15 per chair? I can come get them right away,No but I would take $125
How about $110?,They look brand new.  $120?
"Hi, are the tires of the bike in good condition?",Yes they are. I replaced them at the start of the season and just don't have the time to ride like I thought I would. My loss is your gain.
"Great! How's the body of the bike, any dents or scratches?","The body is pretty good but the paint could use refreshing. What it lacks in beauty, it more than makes up for in comfort. :)"
What kind of seat does it have? Is it the normal padding or memory foam?,It's not memory foam but it is a high grade foam. Just as comfortable for a fraction of the cost. I work on bikes as a mechanic and this one is my baby. But I'd rather see her used than sitting in storage. $60 and she's yours.
Would you take $54?,"Sure, if you pay in cash tonight. I can even bring it to you"
Hi! I saw this alarm clock dock online and love the details! Could you tell me a bit more about it?,Yes! Like the description says its an Iphone/ipod charging dock thats also an alarm clock and radio. It fits an iphone 5 or less and it's in great condition.
Perfect! How much are you willing to sell it for?,I would like to get $50 for it but I'm willing to neogatiote. Can you pick the item up?
I am willing to pay 35 if i come and pick it up.,Ok $35 seems like a fair price to me.
Hi there. Is this available?,yes
Is this used?,Yes but it is in great shape
any scratches or rims?,Nope. Like brand new.
okay good. The price is high for me can you accept 535 for it?,It still has the service and warranty on it. I can go down to 575.
"okay since its what I have been looking for months, I will take it. I haven't been able to get this for so long. Can you please ship it to me?",Sure but depending on the cost I might have to add more to the price.
That's not a problem. Great then we've got the deal?,Deal
Hi! Is your phone still available?,"yes it is. Its new and in excellent condition, so im selling it for $280. It's white and has 32GB."

"Hello, I just seen your ad for the Ethan Allen dresser. I love it, it would be perfect for my new apartment. Are there any dings, dents or scratches on it?",Well it had a few minor scratches with with covered with a brown marker. They were small so it covered them pretty well. You cannot really tell. There are no other dings or dents. Very nicely made.
"It IS wonderfully made. Looks like a little antique. But that's the Ethan Allen value. However, I see you are asking $85, but at the moment I am on a tight budget. Will you be willing to accept $76 for it?","I think that would be fair. I am partial to Ethan Allen myself as he is actually and this is true, one of my ancestors. 76 would be fine."
"Hi how are you doing I'm interested in your chest, can you tell me what size is it?",31 W x 15 D x 29 H

Can you tell is if the price includes any utilities?",I understand that its a bit pricey but it is in a great school district and I can furnish the home for you
"Hmm, we have our  own furnishings currently. Would you expect to have the furnishings returned to you at the end of our rental period? We were really hoping to not pay more than $2000 if the property didn't include utilities.","you can keep the furniture, I can accommodate you and your family for $2000"
"Hello, I'm interested in buying the bike.  I am short on cash, but I really like the bike.  Can I buy it for $125?",I can't do $125.  I can do $165 if that will help you out.

I can come down a little bit if you are willing to sign a longer lease. I can offer $2000 with a 18 month lease"
"Hmm. My original budget was $1100, but I could go up to $1500. I'm very interested in the property and would be willing to sign a longer lease. I can also provide references and do not have any pets. Do you think you could come down that much?","I can do 1750, with a 3 year lease. But the down payment will be $100 more"

Well I was thinking I could do $92,Your price is definitely fair. But I can only do it if you will be willing to pick it up yourself.
I think we could arrange that,Sounds good to me.
Hi I am interested in this cabinets. Are you selling it?,I am renting this apartemtn and the cabinets are included
Sorry the apartment. Is it in a good location?,its in a great location and we have many amenties like a swimming pool and in a great school district
Good but the price is way too high are you willing to go down?,I am willing to go down a little
I can give 1838?,that is much too low how about $2100
how about 2000?,I will accept $2000
Great then when can we get on with the deal?,yes enter in final agreement
"Hi, I am interested in purchasing your media console but the price is a bit too high. Are there any problems with it? Will you go lower?",Theres a few scratches on the top (you can see them in the photos). Other than that it is in good shape.
"Well, I would like to offer 50 for it. I feel that is is fair and I am on a bit of a budget.",If you come with cash to my house and pick it up today I can go to $60. That's the lowest I can do. I paid $200 for it last year.
Hi there. I really would like this amp. I don't need the plugs. I realize your price is $150 in cash without the plugs. Is there any way we can get down to $100?,It's 4 channels though.  How about $115
Your word is the amp works perfectly? And it's in mint condition?,"Yes, absolutely.  The quality is superior to anything else you can find"
"Okay I can come up with $115 in cash. Final offer though, do you accept?","Yes, thank you"
Yes it looks beautiful. Is there a backyard?,There's no individual backyard but there's a communal outdoors area that you won't be responsible for maintaining!
That's great. The wife and kids will love that. Does it come fully furnished?,"No, you'll be responsible for furnishing it yourself."
"Hmm that may be a problem with all of those steps we need to climb. The bed, the grand piano, the grandfather clock...",No worries! It's a first-floor apartment
Why was the unit extensively remodeled after only 2 years? Was there some sort of damage?,"Not particularly. We like to replace all carpets after tenants who have pets -- even if there is not extensive damage, we find new tenants enjoy the brand-new features. If you think you might be interested in a tour, we can set something up?"
We can but the price seems a bit steep for only 2 bedrooms. I know the asking price is $2595 but would $2000 be doable?,"Sorry, no. That's much too low for the area. I'm confident we'll have interest in the apartment at $2595. I can drop it as low as $2495."
Hey is there anything wrong with this?,"Hi, are you interested in the rocker?"
Yes I am.,Nothing wrong with it.  We just changed the decor and wanted it to go to a nice home.
Okay and does the cushion also come with it?,Yes it does.  In fact I have 4 cushions I could throw in to make the deal sweeter.
That'd be awesome. Could I come pick it up today?,I'm asking 60$ are you cool with that?
Could yo do $40?,"No, I'm giving you 20 in cushions.  I have to get 60.  I can deliver it also."
If you deliver I think I can swing 60 then.,"Ok, I think we've got a deal!"
"Hello, is this apartment still available?",yes it is it is a nice place with a great layout
It sounds great but this price is a little steep. I was looking for something closer to $2000. Would that be acceptable?,I could come down to 2400
"That's still a little bit too much. Are any utilities included? If not, then I could take it for $2200 to make sure I can keep the lights and water on.",Utilities are included. if you signed up for the full 13 months I could do 2300
Any stains or issues with this?,"No it is in perfect condition.  Pet free, smoke free and kid free house"
I can take care of all the moving and pay cash if you're willing to go down a bit?,well how much were you thinking?
"I have 1046 in cash right now. Bonus, moving furniture is my job so I can use professional equipment to make sure your doors and walls aren't scratched on the way out!",well I did pay over 3000 for this so I can't go quite that low I could take $100 off if you could come right away.  Would 1395 work for you?
Is the TV still available?,"Hi, yes it is!i would love for it to end up in your home. have you owned one of these before?"
No I have not. I have been wanting one for quite a while.,they're the best! And this one has been discontinued so you cant find it in stores anymore.
What condition would you say it was in?,Like new because I only had it for 6 months and barely used it. It even still has some of its plastic wrapping from the store
That's great!   Does it have any physical damage on it? Like scratches or anything?,Absolutely no scratches at all and it even comes with 3D glasses if you're into that kind of thing
I would like to make you a offer of 1000,"Thats a tad low. I can do 1100 just for you,today"
HOw about 1080?,You've got a deal
"Hello there, I want to inquire about your apt? Hows the neighborhood? Do you allow pets?",Hello. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. Yes pets are allowed.
"Great, are any utilities included in the price? I see the gym is correct?",I can pay for your water bill if your willing to pay today. Yes we have a new fitness center!
"Can we work out a deal for the rent price. Its a little steep on my end, I can sign a one year lease and pay the deposit and first two months up front, possibly the 3rd month up front too if we work out a decent deal.",I can offer you $1650 that is $300 off!!
"That would be amazing, I will take it. Can we meet tomorrow to look at the place and sign the paperwork?",Yes tomorrow will be a great day.
Hi! Im very interested in your lamps. Why are you selling them? Anything wrong with them?,They are in great vintage condition!
"Do the bulbs still work? $40 is a little high, can you go a bit lower?",Yes the bulbs still work.  I could do $35 for the pair.  If you can pay in cash and pick them up tonight?
"Hello, I am interested in your listing...",Great! So its a great home with great schools!
Is it a noisy neighborhood? My husband has ptsd and too much noise is not a good thing.,"Oh wow, sorry to hear that, but this is a nice and quiet neighborhood. He will love it!"
Is it located near any airports or train tracks? Anything else noisy like that?,Nothing too noisy. It is a close small community.
Ok great. I see that it says one year lease preferred but if I'm moving there for the great schools I wouldn't want to have to uproot the kids to another school after just 1 year... is there any way that can be extended?,I can do a 2 year lease if you need.
Hmm yeah that still leaves me with the same problem since the kids will be in school longer than 2 years. I could save up for a better place in the same school district if the price was a bit lower,"Yea, thats up to you. I'm looking for 3700, but I would be willing to willing with you."
Well all things considered I think I could do $3150. How does that sound?,"How about 3,300?"
looks good how does 180 sound,that's below what I wanted. I do include delivery
190 ill pick up,it's a bmx bike in good condition. How about 300
ok,Awesome I can send the courier to you today. What's the address?
hi,hi
"Being a used item, I will offer $150.","whoa there fella. talk about low balling. i'll tell you seeing as how we're moving and we need to sell this, i'm willing to let it go for, say... 300."
"Anything else you can throw in, that's still too high.","it has a footbaord that comes with it already. I guess I could throw in my daughter's old make up sets. but they're used. there are quite a few items in there probably 30 things. foundation, eye kits, etc. she's moved out and no one is using them"
"Sorry not interested in used makeup.  I am willing to pickup, for $200.",yeah. no can do for that low. guess we have no deal.
"Yes, are these made from oak?","Yes, and if you have any children, there are amazing schools around."
Will lights and cable be included or is that separate?,That is included.
What about can I have pets and what about heat?,"Pets are allowed everywhere except the pool area and their is an AC in the home, so you can control how cool and warm you are."
"Hello, I am very interested in your kitchen island. Can you send a photo?","I am sorry, there are no photos available. However you can come by and see it."
Doing great. I am very interested in this beautiful wood armoire.,"Excellent so can I answer any of your questions about it, I am asking just 80 for it!"
The main thing I was wondering was if the shelves were adjustable in height and what condition the wood was in/,The shelfs are removable but to set them at different heights you would need to do some slight mods.  The woods is in the excellent condition!
I could pick up today and have $72 cash in hand.,That sounds like a good deal to me!
Hello,"Hi, interested in Macbook?"
"Yes indeed, I saw your listing and the Macbooks look in pretty good shape. I'm starting my next college semester soon, and I needed to get something for class. $300 is a little steep for my budget, but I can definitely go up to around $275 if that is cool with you.","Yeah, I think I can work with that. I have some different ones you can look at."
Very interested! Is there wiggle room on the price?,"I'd be open to a little negotiation, what are you comfortable paying?"
Well I'd like to pay closer to $2400 if that is possible,"Hmm, that's a little low for me. If I covered utilities, would you be able to pay $3000?"
That is a good deal I think I could do that!,Great!
"hi there, just saw the post. so all three are welded togethere huh?","No, you're getting three separate tables that we had made for a party by a friend of ours who is a welder. They are tall tables for an outdoor party, but you could use stools at them if you didn't want to have to stand."
So im roughly a couple hours away from your location. i was wondering if you could compensate with gas. I have an idea of where i want to put them but i dont know if i like the colors. I may need to repaint as well,I could knock the price down to $70 so you could use $5 for gas.
2 hours is a bit more than $5 lol. I have a truck that im putting them in. What do you say i take it off your hands for $50?,I'll go as low as $65.
$55 and im on my way over to you now.,deal
I am well and you?,Very well are you interested in my offer?
I am but your listing price is really high for a jr 1 bedroom for that area.,It is a beautiful apartment but i would be willing to go down to 1800 and no lower.
I am a injured vet on a limited budget. I have a service dog. Is there any was you could possibly go a little lower?,I would be willing to go to 1700 but any lower and i am losing.
Fair enough. My service dog would be no issue?,not at all cats and dogs welcome
"Yes I am interested, are their any rips or tears on it?","Nope, We're selling it for around $309 because its in perfect condition. We love it but have to get rid of it solely based on space. We need more space in our room and its a big item, while our room is small."
I would be willing to pay cash today if you could go down to $278.  I can pick it up within the hour,"Okay, that works well as I don't have a truck to deliver it with! Thanks a lot for your understanding!"
Hello,Hi there. Are you interested in the bike?
"Yes I am. Is it in good condition? I really want a good one, cause my last one broke down and cannot be repaired.","Yes. It is in great condition, almost like new."
How much would you like for it?,"Since it's in such good condition, I'm asking 850."
I would like to pay 425. Would that work for you?,"That's too low. The bike is like new. I hardly ever rode it. It's always been inside, so no wear and tear."
How about 700 then?,I'll bring it to you for 800.
Hey there. This couch looks fantastic! Is it in really good condition? LIke new?,These are beautiful and almost new as we changed our color scheme not to long after we bought them
Sweet. Could you come down to $1500 for them if I come and pick them up in my truck?,They are black and will go with anything. Not really a couch but theater seating
"Yeah I see. I will lay 3 like a couch and 1 as its own chair, It will work fantastically in my living room. So are you fine with $1500? I'll come over and pick them up today.","No, I paid a fortune for them. Can you do 1650.00?"
Okay fine Ill go $150 higher if you insist.,Great it looks like I willl accept the offer.
How old is your sofa,Like new the pickture clearly shows the condition
I would love to buy but only have 275,soory sale price is 550
Would you be willing to trade?,depends on the offer
"I can offer $300, pickup today and a $20 walmart giftcard",I am sorry but that offer is borderline insulting I am happy to wait for another person for a fair offer.
$400?,I am sorry the original pice was twice what i am asking. The only damage is in a low visibility area and easily repaired it would cost less than the price difference to have it professionally repaired. the best i can do is $500
Hi!,"Hi, how are you today?"
I'm great what about you?,"Doing great, are you looking for a place to rent?"
"Yes, how's the local area?","It's a safe, family friendly area with lakes nearby. Very beautiful area."
"Great, if I pay a years worth of rent up front can I have it be 2950?",I think we can work a deal out of that :)
Yes. Does it come with the batteries?,"Yes, it comes with 2 new coin batteries"
Do the batteries have a lot of use on them?,"No, they have never been used. The item is brand new in sealed packaging"
Will you take $25?,"25 is a little low. I could do 30$. I paid  over 50$ for it, so this is a good deal."
"I am, but I think that's a bit much for a used bike. Would you go lower?","What price did you have in mind.  It's a really great bike, so I don't want to be lowballed."
How about $1000? I can come get it right away.,"If you can pay $1100, I will deliver it to you.  Deal?"
Hello! I see you have a 4 bedroom home,"Yes, and I would like to rent out the upstairs - 2 bedrooms and a bath."
how are the schools in that area?,The schools here are very highly rated.
what exactly do you look for on the credit check?,I want to be sure there are no evictions.
"ok, I don't have that problem lol. I see you are asking $2800 thats a bit steep for me","I could come down a little, but it is a beautiful home that I think you'll love."
I can afford about $1959,I would need at least $1650. I still have to pay the house payment and taxes on it.
ok so I can afford $1959,"Oh, I am sorry, I made a typo. I meant to say $2650. But what about $2600, since I made that mistake?"
Yes I am. What condition is this bike?,"It has been well maintained, and tuned by a pro mechanic. Outstanding condition overall, with all sorts of added special features."
Would you accept $775 cash in hands?,"Unfortunately I have to be firm with pricing, as the kit comes with a bike computer, special aero bars, and a custom seatpost. Surely 850 is fair for those addons."
Hello,Hi@
Are you interested in the home? It is a great house in a great neighborhod.,yes would you be willing to do 3000?
"I am. I am willing to lower it a bit more though, since you seem like a nice guy. Would you like a tour of the property?",Naw thats ok I'm a nice guy ill do 3175
How are the tires on this bike?,They are only slightly worn. I just changed them maybe 3 months ago.
Is something wrong with it and that's why you are selling it?,Nothing is wrong with the bike at all. I have gotten a bit bigger and I am not riding it as much. I need money to save up for a new one that will fit me
"Do you think this would be good for a person who is around 5'5""?",Oh yes! It would definitely be perfect for someone of that stature. It's an absolutely amazing bike that has not done me wrong yet.
Awesome. I'd like to offer you 380 for it,Would you be will to do $400?
Yes if you'd accept 400 I could do that.,Its a deal!
"Hello, I'm interested in renting your property",hello.
"Hi, I'm interested in renting your property",okay.  great.  do you have any questions?
Are utilities included in your asking price?  Is there a term lease?,"no, utilities are not included.  You can make an offer of how long you may want to stay."
"Great!  I would like to see it on May 16, in the meantime I'd like to rent for 1 year and since utilities are not included I can pay $1500",I'd be willing to go for $1500 since you want to rent for an entire year.  Do we have a deal?
I think so!  Thanks for agreeing to my price.,okay.  see you on May 16 so you can see the property in person.
See you then,take care
I'm interested in the bar stool. Does it have any stains or scratches?,"No. They are in excellent condition. Also, the covers can be removed and washed or easily replaced at Ikea."
Good to know. They are a bit over my budget. There are very similar ones for sale for $20 but these look a little better. Can you do $30 total?,These chairs are worth 79.99 each. 30 for both is way too low for me. I could maybe do $50
"HI, is the house still available?",Yes and ready for move in immediately
"Does the bathroom have a bathtub,or is it just a shower?","Yes, there is a bathtub and shower. The back house only has a shower."
"Can you accept less for the rent. I only pay 2500 now, but could go as high as 3000$. would that be acceptable?",I was hoping for $3500 but I may go down unless you're bringing a pet. Is it just you or will there be animals?
"I have no pets, and I am very quiet. It is just me and my wife.",That sounds perfect. I'll take $3000
"Good afternoon!  I am interested in the Smart TV.  I can pick it up, and will offer $300 for it.",It is in good condition. I can offer you $360 if you are really interested in
"That is a little more than I was wiling to pay.  I can come up to $340, but that is all I can afford.",I see. It would be ok if you can go and pick them at my house. $340 is okie
Hello. I am interested in the media cabinet you have for sale,Great Im interested in selliing it to you I am having a great big moving sale and need to unload my media storage and I will throw in a dvd player for $20.00
Both DVD player and cabinet for $20? That sounds like a good deal,"Yeah, you want it come get it."
"Hello, is this timer still for sale?",it sure is! It works like a charm. no issues.
How often has the item been used?,not very often. I dont go on many vacations
So this is only for vacation stuff?,you can use it whenever you want and are away from home.

How old is it?,2 months
Seeing how this isn't a brand new item would you take $4?,i can definitely go down one dollar. if you can pick up tonight. see you soon!
This looks like a really nice used truck.  How many miles are on it?,"right at 95,000"
"Not bad at all.  I have been looking for a truck like this.  I am willing to offer $15,200 for it, and I will come pick it up if that price is right.","I would take 15,750"
"I am a CPA, and if I can get the truck for $15,200, I will prepare your income tax returns for you free of charge for as long as I own the truck.","I don't need that, but thanks. Like I said looking at the blue book value you are getting steal at 15,750 with the low mileage."
Hi!  What are you asking for the Prius?,Hello... my asking price is $9500
"i am, whats a lazy susan?",A
a?,Sorry typo a lazy Susan I for your drinks and it swivels for easier access
"oh i see, although it looks like a beautiful dining room set, $1000 seems awfully steep for a used set. ill give you $500 for it",I could go lower as you would have to pick it up
"sure that wont be a problem, how low were you thinking you could go?",I could go 500. It was my grandma's so I don't think she would mind
interesting looking table you dot there,I moving out soon and I can give it to you for ONLY 120$
"I see. tell you what, I'll give you 100 bucks for it cash",How about 110$? It's really a low offer for this table
"Hi there, I am interested in the boombox. How old is it?","Hello! It's 24 years old, but it's been tested and is totally functional with no missing parts. I can also give you a demo before purchase if you're interested."
Are there any scratches on it?,"Not a single one, it's in a really good condition."
I am really interested in it and would be willing to meet today with cash in hand. Would you be willing to come down on the price?,"It's a vintage item, so I wouldn't be willing to go too low, but sure, it's all yours today for $60."
Hi I am interested in the bike you have,"Great! Its lightly used, but great for all purposes!"
"I see that it has the origional seat, is the seat in good condition?",Great condition!
"I would have to buy a new brake cable and chain, can you come down to $30?",How about 60?
60 is a little too high when I have to buy new parts to make it usable. How about 45?,How about I bring it to you for 55?
50 and youhave a deal!,Deal!
I do. I have a dog would she be able to come with me?,"No, I apologize, but we do not accept pets."
There is no way around that rule?,"No, we make no exceptions to the rule, unfortunately. Are you still interested in purchasing?"
"I am, but I'm only interested in paying $3100 then",I can't accept that amount. Would $3575 work for you?
No that is too high for me. My budget is only up to $3300 and that is cutting it close,"Since $3300 is your budget, how would $3375 work for you?"
Is there a security deposit too,No security deposit.
"Hey, this phone is nice, what do you want for it?",I am asking $300. It has never been used.  It is currently a TMobile phone.
"Yeah, I can't spend that much, it's going to cost money to get it reactivated and it's not the latest gen phone brand. How does 200 sound?","You also get the protective case with it.  If you would be able to do $250, we have a deal."
240 final offer,I can do that. $240 it is.
Hi.,hi
Hi there.  I'm quite interested in purchasing your bike?,"Great, It is in great condition and is a 10 speed. I only used it a few times."
What did you pay for it when you bought it?,It was 1250 when I bought it.
It sure looks like a nice bike.  What do you want for it?,I am asking 800 but I am open to offers!
"How about $736, and I will also pick it up?",That sounds really fair and since I do not have to deliver it I will let you have it for 700.
"Seller, please bring out the COMFY CHAIR","Selling this amazingly comfortable chair for only $50. I paid $200 for it but recently remodeled my living room and it just doesn't go with the room anymore, so my loss is your gain!"
I find it hard to believe it cost you $200. Does it have soft cushions?,So soft it's like floating on a cloud! We've had friends stop over and they all comment on how they don't want to get up after sitting in it!
I'll pay no more than $45 for it.,"Sounds good to me, you won't be disappointed!"
Is this a month to month or lease period?,"I can do month to month if that's better for you, but I prefer a lease of either 6 months or 1 year."
I've heard this is the area of the Bay city bomber.  Is the area safe?,"Although that incident was very tragic, the area is generally very safe and has a low crime rate."
Are you willing to negotiate the price?  I'm concerned about copycats and would be a little uncomfortable.,Of course. Give me an offer.
How about 1150,I like it to be more around 1350.
I would sign a 1 year lease for 1200/mo.  and would be able to move in next month.,I'll agree to a one year lease at 1300/mo.
I am! But to be honest it is quite a bit over my budgeted price. With the current price difference I was even hesitant to contact you but I was hoping that you might have some wiggle room.,I am open to hearing offers.
"I wish I could, but I just can't get over $1600.",Oh wow that is really low. if you can come up to 2500 it is yours. This is a very popular area and a great vacation rental.
"I agree, and it is gorgeous! If I could get up there I would. Unfortunately my hands are so very tied! What about a trade for work? I'll pay $1700 but will repaint the interior of the house for you. To the colors of your choosing of course!","It is not in need of any paint or work, sorry. you are not going to find any better deal out there for this area or time. I coudl waive the animal deposit if you have one, but $2500 is already a thousand off asking price."
Yes. I agree. It's a great price. I wish I had wiggle room. But $1750 is the most I have. Could we do $2000 and you retain the right to rent out the cowboy cabin for more money? Maybe to make up the difference? Unfortunately that's the last offer I can do.,"alright , that seems fair to both of us."
"Hi, I'm really interested in these tables, they're gorgeous!",Thank you.They are barely used as I moved right after I bought them and did not have room in my new apartment. I'm willing to drive them to you if you can offer my asking price as I'd like to get rid of them.
"I want them but your asking price is way more than I can afford in my budget right now. I'd gladly take them off your hands for $50, cash today","How about 80, with me driving them to you, and I can save them for two weeks if you'd like if you want to get more money together."
"I appreciate it but that's still a little too high. I can drive out and pick them up myself, I have a truck","My lowest is 70. If that won't be possible, I will have to pass on your offer. Sorry!"
"Hi, I am interested in the phone.",what is your offer
Has this phone ever been used? Any damage or scratches?,nope brand new
So it is still in the box? All paperwork for it still available? Is it unlocked?,yes  stiill in box
You didn't answer the question about the Paperwork?,all the paper work is in the box and it unlocked
"I am interested in the phone, however, I think the asking price is a little high. Would you be willing to accept $450?",i take 500
$475 is the highest I can go for this phone. Cash in hand today!,475
You got a deal then.,ok
Wow! I love your table! What kind of use has it seen?,"Thank you. It has been in my family for many, many years. It used to get normal use, but always had a tablecloth on it. It is in mint condition."
"I can't tell in the picture, but is it broken down for transporting or would I need a truck to come get it?","When I moved it, I had to use a truck."
"Hmmm. Since I'd have to borrow a truck from a friend, can we bring the price down a little? Maybe $100?",I could bring it to you for $115 so you dont have to borrow someone else's vehicle.
That would be perfect! Sounds great!,Thank you!
It is nice.,also has lots of new parts
It seems well maintained,very well maintained and has a clean title i'm wiling work with you on it
"$3800 seems a bit steep, I don't know if I can do that much",how  about $3500
"Its a 16 year old car, I feel like I'm paying for the brand and not for the functionality","the car runs great and you will love it, has several new parts the lowest i can go is$3000"
I can't do it. There are bound to be issues with a 16 y/o car.,"well i don't want to sell cheaper than that if you find one in better condtion i'll buy it $3,000 or no deal"
"You drive a hard bargain, but I guess you're right. Deal!",ok can you also pick up
I can do that.,ok noon today
Hello! I'm calling about the Apartment Home for rent. How big are the units?,"They are one-bedroom and one-bath but are very spacious. Units are 1,100 feet! And there are many amenities included such as a gym and business center."
"$2151 a month is pretty steep for a place that's only 1,100 sq feet. Anyway we can get the rent down to $1900? I'd even be willing to sing a 2 year lease on it at that price.",We could go to 2000 a month and I will throw in the HBO package with your T.V. subscription!
"$1930 and we skip the HBO? I don't really watch TV anyway, so a $75 cable package would just be wasted on me.",The lowest I could go would be $1950 plus a $100 Visa Gift Card as a signing bonus.
hi i can offer you a great price if the apartment is nice,yes its in great condition
whats some perks about the apartment,no perks
i can offer $1932,how does 2300 sound? it has an attached garage which is great for an apartment
thats more than the orignal price plus i can't afford that can you work with me on the price,2000 and we have a deal my friend
thats to high for me,1950
that works for me when can i move in,tomorrow
I am interested in you iphone,"OK, do you have any questions about it for me?"
how long has the corner of the screen been lifted?,"About 2 weeks, it hasnt' affected the usage of the phone."
Thank you. Have you gotten a quote on what it will cost to fix it?,"I have not, it wasn't worth the time since it still worked and it was time for me to upgrade."
I feel more comfortable paying $65 since I have to put work in and I'm not sure what it will cost me.,That's only half of what I'm asking. I'd be willing to take 100
Do you have any cases or anything to go with the phone?,It comes with a simply black case and has a screen protector on it that is not peeling or lifted
Ok. How about $80?,90 is the lowest I will go

What's the history on this rental unit?,"Nothing to special. Just a nice little unit that recently came open. We freshened it up a bit and have put it up for rent. Great neighborhood, and great schools. Really a great unit."
"I am on a budget, could I rent it for $2600?",That's a bit under what I can afford on the unit as I have payments I have to make myself. I could come down to 2900 if that helps. That is cutting my profit margin pretty close.
Let's make a deal,this desk is very well maintained and like new
"Great. I can pick it up in the next hour if we can agree on a price. 140 is too steep, though",yes if you pick it up i can go for $125

Hi. I'm interested in your arm chairs. How firm is that price point?,"Hey there! The price isn't too firm, we can reason here. They are in great condition, barely used, no damage at all."
That's great sounds great. I love the English style. I was looking to spend around 140 dollars but I'll meet you in the middle. How is 215 for you?,$215 will work great. Can you come by and pick them up? I can't really deliver them at this time because my truck is in the shop and they wont fit in my replacement car. It would help out a ton!

We would need to come up with a better solution...,You dont the table?
"Hello, this looks great!!","Thanks, I'm starting at $650."
Hi. How are you? I am willing to pick up the desk disassembled for $10. Does this work for you?,"I'm sorry, but that price is too low, these tables are in good condition."
"Ok. What price do you think is more reasonable? I could do $12, but don't want to go much more above that. I can pick them up and assemble them, saving you work and time.","Well, that's closer to what I could do, but maybe we should really talk about this for another two minutes, to get to the bottom of this important trade."
What is the lowest amount you are willing to sell the desks for?,"Id be willing to let the pair go for $18, delivered."
"Since I originally wanted $10 and you originally wanted $20, let's meet in the middle and say $15. I can pick them up at that price.","Okay, sounds fair."

Hi I would like to negotiate the price considering I will have to buy and fix some of it.,I understand. I'm willing to negotiate
So I will have to buy a battery cap that's missing and might have to fix the set if it's not sturdy so how about $92 cash and I can take it off your hands?,I think that will work. It is close to my asking price.
I was looking for more storage but I am interested in this phone.,I'll sell you my phone for $600 if you come walk my dog
Not walking your dog and I can pretty much pick up a $600 phone anywhere but if you make it $450.00 I would walk your dog for a week.,okay deal
"Yes I am, but I'll be honest right off the bat, I can't pay listing price.  20 thousand is my offer.","Well right to the point. I can't go that low but to sweeten the deal I would be able to deliver the truck to you and purchase an additional warranty for up to 100,000 miles. For all this I would ask 25500"
Hello,Hey
I love this property! It seems to be very convenient for me,Is the price okay?
I think its a bit high,what are you willing to pay for?
I love the fact that its in walking distance to public transportation,what are you willing to pay for?
Im a bit tight on money I can pay $1100,"Hmm I'm sorry that is way too low for all the conveniences it has, walking distance of coffee shops, gyms and schools, how about 1800?"
You do make a good point it is still a still at that price.,"Alright, you won't regret it!"
"Yes, I might be. Are there any problems with the sofa?",Absolutely none! I've only owned it for one year and it is in absolutely pristine condition.
"Well, if it's in such great condition, why are you getting rid of it?","You see, I just got a new kitten for my daughter. They are absolutely inseparable! But this sofa is a (hard to come by) light grey Italian leather and the kitten unfortunately sheds a LOT. I just don't like how it looks in the living room anymore and it is difficult to keep hair-free. Not to worry, I'm having it professionally cleaned to remove all pet dander!"
"Well, if this kitten is such a burden, I'd be glad to take it off your hands for $225.","Since it is being cleaned and it is a very high quality leather, much less in a rare shade of grey, I would be willing to take 325 for it."
"Well, now I'm interested in this kitten too. I'll tell you what, if you throw in the kitten, I'll take the sofa a $375.","Oh no no, I cannot part with the kitten. She is family. But she did come from a litter that still has kittens available from. She is a high quality breed. I can give you the contact info. The owner is a dear friend of mine and I can get her to give you an excellent deal on the kitten. I can take 300 for the sofa"

I was never allowed to have friends over :( I payed 200 a piece for them, my buddy Ric is listing them in his store but I'd like to move them quickly. I don't think 300 for the set is asking too much"

I'm interested in the Jaguar you have for sale.,"Great, please let me know if you have any questions. The price is 3500 and it runs great!"

Hello. I'm interested in the bike. Would you accept $25?,wow that's so low. I am selling it at 65
"It looks like it will need a lot of work, though.",Yeah but 25 is not worth what you're getting. We need to be on a middle ground here
I might pay $40. Can you bring it to my house?,I can bring it but in next two weeks not anytime soon

How about 1700? I am on a tight budget and any little bit I can save is great.,"I certainly understand! However, the property owner does not want to go lower that $1800 minimum. Can you swing it?"
"Yes, that is fine. Let's make the deal.",Great!
Hey!,Are you interested in the sofa I have for sale?
Yes! I have been looking for a Finn Grand Sofa for some time now!,Ok great! It's like new.  I'm asking $750 for it.
I was thinking more around $375,I can't go that low it is like new.  Do you have any other questions about it?
what is the lowest you will go,I could do 680.
I really like this sofa I have $605 cash right now,Ok sounds great!
"Hey there, nice bike frame","Hi, thanks. Are you interested in purchasing?"
"Yeah definitely, is it used a lot? Just wondering why sell it, it's so high-end",It is not used a lot. I only used it a couple of times but I just don't use it anymore so that is why I'm selling it. It's in pretty great shape.
"Alright, well can you tell me a little more about it? My budget's closer to 1000 and it's used, but let me know",Well given that it was barely used I think I could drop it down to $1500 for you but $1000 is a little too low for me.
R8R,What do you think?
"Sorry about that, I meant to say I found a premade R8R for 1500 so I was confused why the frame itself was running me the same price. Can you do 1400 final offer?","Okay, yeah I can do $1400"

"Excellent, could you take 3400 for the rent, a friend of mine rents there and he pays 3300",Well the rent DOES get reduced with the longer one stays at the residence.   Your friend has probably been at the property for some time.     I could accept $3400 for the rent if you want to waive the power + water bill and get those utilities cut on in your name?

I really need to be around $825","If you are willing to come in and sign our 13 month lease today, I can waive your deposit. this would still keep rent at 979 but overall save you almost 1000 dollars"
That is a pretty good deal.  I would be willing to sign a 24 month lease if you could get it down to $900,"okay, thats a deal. You have to be in my office before close today to make this deal!"

I can offer $125 and pick it up later today.,That sounds like a deal
Yes I am interested in this hutch but I would like to now if you are willing to come down on the price?,"The price I am afraid is as low as I can go. It is a $3500 piece originally. That is Italian Marble. It is imported and that is real wood, something that is hard to find these days. This beauty is a huge deal at only $1000"
Can I offer you $750 for it?,"I appreciate your interest but with the handcrafting, that is just too big a loss for the showroom to take. I do have another customer interested in this piece but they wanted to talk about splitting up the amount on two different cards. I can't let it go for that low when I have a buyer willing to pay the price on the item"
How about $900 all cash?,Deal. It is a big loss to the store but I think you see great value in this item and that means you will be back to shop with us again. Thank you and when would you like it delivered?

"Well, it's a nice price but it is a few years old.","yes and at that condition, these are over 2500 bucks. it's a steal i'm telling you"
Could you let it go for $825?,um. no. not even close.

Would you take $200?,"this bike has lots of great features, i can do 220"
Yes. Today.,of say about noon $200 is fine thanks
Hello,"Hi. I would love to get rid of this bike soon. It is 800 and a great price, seeing that it cost much more when it was originally purchased."
I'm looking at getting this for my son for his birthday. Can you tell me if there is anything wrong with the bike?,"There is nothing wrong with the bike. I'm only selling it because I had surgery, gained weight, and am too big for the bike. I think your son will love it! I only rode it twice, making it like new."
Did anyone own it before you?,I am the only owner. I would like to sell it for $800. How does that price sound to you?
I was hoping closer to $600. Is there any room to work?,"Of course! I want your son to have it and for you to get a great price on it. Since I want 800 and you want 600, let's meet in the middle at 700. I'll even include a bid red bow and brand new helmet for your son!"
He'll appreciate the bow. You throw in a new pair of tires with the helmet and ill do $700.,"For new tires, I'd have to do 725. $725 includes new tires, a helmet, and a red bow. Is that a deal? If so, please make an offer."
"I would like to purchase the Apple EarPods, I am willing to offer $14",I am sorry the best I can do is $21
"I have owned these EarPods and know of their quality, could you go down to $16",As you well know then these are of the highest quality but because you have experience with these I will  go down to $18 . My final offer
Wow what a cool lamp you have for sale! How much are you asking for it?,"Yes, Isn't cool. I am asking $65 for it"
"Ouch, I was thinking more like $30 since it has some wear from its old age and being used so much",Well It Is Mid Century and that is what gives it it's Charm. I can go as low as $47
"I'll do $37 and I'll come get it right now, I can't wait to spit polish it!",You are getting a really awesome lamp. I will let it go for $37
Hi there!,This is in perfect condition and was only used for about 6 months before I upgraded.
"Ok, that's great. What networks will this phone work with?",It works with the sprint network as it sits but I know a guy that can open it if you want it for another network.
Hmm... and the screen is not cracked right? The buttons work fine as well?,Not even any scratches on it.  It is in perfect condition and looks brand new.
How much storage does it have?,It is 16 gb.
Awesome. So how much do you want for this phone?,I am asking $99 but I will drop it to $79 if you bring me some lunch when you come to get it.
"Hmm. That is a really good offer. I'll go with that deal but for $69 instead, how about that?",That works.
"Hi, is your dining table still for sale?",It sure is. I just put it up today
Are you willing to be flexible on the price?,"Not really, this is solid wood like new, not Ikea"
"I ask because I've seen new solid wood tables for on sale for about $1,000.  For a used table, I would expect to pay at least a bit less.",They don't sell them like  this anymore with the 4 extensions leaves.   - also comes with glass top - that's rare
I did not realize from the ad that this also has a glass top.  Are you able to deliver the table across town?,"Yes, the custom glass cut to fit game table size top would be difficult to transport unless have the kine Pick up truck  set up for that.  I can do that for you so don't break in transportation."
"Sounds wonderful.  Looks like we have a deal, then.",GREAT!.  Has to be over the weekend but will accept. :) Enjoy!
"Hello, I'm doing well is the chest you have for sell still available?",Yes it is still available is there any questions that you have about it?
Yes I do. How old is the chest?,I've had it for less than a year and it has some light scratches but it is in great condition!
Are you the original owner?,No there was one I think before me
What has the chest mainly been used for?,It's actually not really been used alot by me but has been in storage mostly
Is it 100% Cedar?,Yes it is!
Due to the fact that it is probably on the older side and does have some scratches would you be willing to let it go for $45 if I picked it up today & paid in cash?,Yes that would be fine
"Hello, can you give me some details for the house?","Hi, this place is beautiful?  What kind of a budget are you working with?"
"Hello, I'm well. Is this bed still available?","I am great..  And yes, it is..  Do u have any questions?"
Yes. What didn't your wife like about the bed?,There wasn't really one specific thing.  She just enjoys the bed we have now.  It is in excellent condition and comes from a smoke and pet free home.
How many times was the bed used?,"We basically took ours off and put this on, but she decided after a nights sleep on it, that she preferred ours better."
Is it the latest model?,"Yes..  Cost well over $2,000.."
Why are you selling it for only $500 then?,"I just want it out of here.  I figured if I asked more than that, that it wouldn't sell quickly.  I don't have the space to continue to store it and I will deliver for free.."
Okay that makes sense. I will take it off your hands for $500,Awesome.. Thx.  You will love it!
good how are you. I am inquiring about your lamps for sale,"Yes, they are lovely. Passed down from my mother. Would go well in any home."
is there any scratches on them. How long did she have them. And yes they asre very lovely,She was a neat freak and kept them in excellent condition. I have them list for $40.
"Hey.  I was looking to buy a home and I came across your ad.  I have an outdoor only dog, so I must ask if the back yard is fenced?",Yes it is. How much are you looking to spend on this?
"Well, my wife isn't currently working because we just had a child, so our budget is a bit reduced.  However, we'd still like to buy a home to have a little extra space for our expanded family.  I was hoping I could get something for around $1500.",That sounds fair. How about 1800? Does that sound fair to you?
"I mean, it's a little over my budget, but with the fenced backyard and the easy commute to work, I think that's a good price.  Additionally, in a few months my wife will be back to work, so we'll only have the extra financial stress for a short time, hopefully.  I can do $1800.",Good doing business with you.
"Hi, I am very interested in this heated foot massager.",I'm askimg $20 would you like to pick it up today?
I could pick up today but I only have $18,I can do $18.
"I'm considering yours, it looks very nice and comfy!","its very soft and has neutral colors, so it will go with just about any color scheme. its has throw pillows and removable cushion covers too, so its easy to wash and keep clean. i'm asking 430"
Can you tell me anything about the breakage on the right arm rest?,"its fairly minor, it can be easily patched up. a couch like this would normally go for a well over 1000 new"
"How old is the couch? Furniture depreciates very quickly, you know.","its only a couple of years old, how much are you looking to spend?"
I'm looking to spend about $200.,"that is far too low I'm afraid. I'd be willing to part with it for about $400, but only if you can arrange for the pickup"
"I can definitely do pick up, but I can really only go up to $250 for a used couch with a tear in it.","that's still too low. look, because there is a tear in it, i'll even throw in a patching kit. give me $375, and its yours"
Hello! Are you interested in buying my fitbit?,I'm interested in selling you my fitbit.
Hi. I'm interesting in buying your car. However I have a few questions.,"Sure go ahead, my asking price is $9200."
Does it need any repairs?,"No, my car is fairly new. I bought it new in 2015 and have had no problems since, but I can take it to a mechanic to confirm and send you the details after if you agree to purchase the car."
Okay. Great. Are you a smoker?,Nope!
Great.,"Are you able to see the entire ad? It's a white Toyota Prius C Two Hatchback, 4D, automatic.It also has a lot of other cool features like cruise control and bluetooth."
Yes. Would you accept $8000 for it?,"It's a little low for me, I can accept $8200."
Okay. Deal.,Perfect.
What kind of condition is it in?,"It is in excellent condition, if you decide to purchase it at the full price I will provide you with a Celine Dion CD"
I am very interested in this but I was thinking more around $20. Can we work something out? I own a business and need this,"Sure because you asked politely, 20 dollars is fine."
"Hi, I'm inquiring about the phone?",It's a gray iPhone 6 with 128GB of memory. It's unlocked. It comes with a lightning cable.
is the screen is good shape as well?,The screen show somes signs of wear from previous use. It's fully functional though.
"excellent, are you flexible on the price I was thinking more like 200$",Ideally I would like to get $300 for the phone. Unlocked iPhones usually demand a higher price.
I have an interest in your desk that you have for sale.  Do you happen to know the dimensions?,"Yes it is 7ft long, 4ft wide, and 3.5 ft tall."
That's a good sized desk.  Do you know how old it is?  It looks pretty new!,"It's only a few months old, rarely used. really need to get rid of it. You will need a large truck to pick it up as we are in a wharehouse."
Do you know whether it folds up or could be taken apart easily?,Yes it can be folded up for easier transport. I'm asking 200$ but willing to negotiate.
I was going to offer $110 or $140 if you could deliver. I'm less than 2 miles away.,"Unfortunately I cannot deliver, but $110 sounds fair to me."
Does it have good batteries? Any scratches?,Flawless condition.
I could do $145,$155
Meet you half way at $150.,Sounds great. Sold for $150.
Yes I am very interested. Does it roll nicely or do the wheels jam?,"It rolls very well, which scope do you have?"
"I actually have the Tektronix 7000 series, that's why I was considering this. Can you wiggle from the price a little bit?","I suppose so, $40? that's half what this cart goes for in used condition"
"Hi, yes I am. How old is it? How long does the battery hold?",It is only about a month old. The battery lasts for about 5 hours of riding. I usually charge it every other ride to be safe.
Do you have a backup battery? What did it cost you new?,"I do not have a back up batter but, they are fairly cheap online. It cost me 700 new."
Could you do $330?,lowest I could do is 360 but you would have to come pick it up for me to even go that low.
"I'm sorry that is kind of outrageous. I can come pick it up, but but for $340.",offering to give me less than half of what I paid is outrageous lmao.I will go down to 350 but no lower
Yes,Do you have any questions about the listing?
Not that I can think of. It's pretty nice,"I'm asking 2,800, are you interested in the option to buy? Or just a lease?"
I would like to buy. Would you be willing to negotiate? I can buy right away if the price is right.,"It's a great neighborhood, and it is listed at 2,800. I believe that is a fair price."
"I just saw your rug for sale, and am interested","Sure, it is brand new , in great condition and it's selling for $550"
Hello I am interested in this bike,That's great. How long have you been riding? This bike is for advanced riders
I've been riding for a couple years now. I see the listing mentions its for big people. So does it not work for kids?,"It would be good for large teenagers who are over 5'4"" but not smaller than that. Younger children won't be able to reach the peddles. However, the frame does allow for both a trailer and a second seat for a passenger"
Great! How about $720?,"I can do $740 and throw in the tire pump, a spare tire, and the yet-to-be installed headlamp"
I like the chair.,"We can't deliver sadly, but you can come pick it up from our garage any time. We're trying to sell for around $50, would that work for you? Also a little disclaimer incase you're allergic to cats, we have cats, so the chair will have some cat dander on it FYI."
I can pay you 35.,"Okay, that seems like a fair price since you're coming to get it. Thanks a lot!"
Hello! How are you doing today?,"Great, how are you?"
Doing well. Are you interested in the phone I'm selling?,I'm selling the unlocked iphone 5 for $130
"I apologize. I meant to type buying. I guess I need more coffee, haha.",No worries! Does $130 work for you? This is for pick up/meet up only.
It the house still available?,Yes.
Would you accept $1550?,"No, that's really low for this very desirable house. It's in a great neighborhood with highly ranked schools, is in excellent condition, and comparable homes in the area are renting for $3500 or more. I would be willing to go down to $2800."
"Hi There!  I would like to buy the phone, but I only have $300.  I do have some other electronics that I could trade with the cash to sweeten the deal.  Are you interested?","No, I can't take any trades."
Are you willing to come down on the price at all?  What is you best price?,"My best price is firm at $650.  The product is brand new, still in the box, and is the most popular variant."
I understand.  I think I can borrow some money.  Can I pay $400?,"No, the price is $650."
"Is anybody else trying to buy this phone?  You have a potential buyer, but you won't negotiate a fair price.  I can go to the store and pay $650.  I'm looking for a deal.  $500 is my final offer.  That is a fair price.","You won't find it in the store, not this color."
"The color is a minor detail.  I always keep expensive phones in a case.  You can buy any color case, so the color isn't going to make me pay $150 more than a fair price.  $500 Deal?",No deal.
hi,Howdy
would you take $200,Hmmm that's too low for me sadly. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?
$230,"Although I'm selling myself short, I can cut you a deal for 265"
You have it listed for 250?,"Unless you're willing to come pick it up and have cash, I'll do 260"
Can you throw in anything else with it? like wiring,"hmmm I can toss some allen wrenches your way, and I can tack on a 3 month warranty"
That works for me,So $260 final deal?
Hi how are you doing today?,I'm doing fantastic! Are you interested in this amazing Clock?
"Yes I am very interested, where did you come across this one?",It was a graduation present from a quirky uncle. It is really nice and I'd keep it but I have no room for it and since I'm moving I really need to find it a new home.
"That's so cool I never heard of any clock like this.  I was hoping you would be able to come down on the price a little bit though, maybe I could trade you an item to make it more fair?",I can't really take any trades but I am VERY flexible on the price.
"Oh sweet well I was hoping to pay more like 375 to suit my budget but I'm sure that's very low for you, would you make me your best offer?",$500 is the lowest I can accept at this time.
Okay I can do that!,Awesome! Thanks!
hello. I am interested in your convertible,Hi. Do you have any questions about the car?
"Hi, are the chairs faded in or is it just the lightinging in the image?","Oh no, that must just be the lighting.  These chairs are in great condition."
And do they have all their wheels and still roll. I ask becuse I have an office chair that one wheel has fallen off and it will roll but it takes work. Once bitten..,"Yes, all wheels are present and accounted for.  If it helps you out, I would be happy to throw in an extra set of wheels for hardwood floors."
That would be great. Would you be willing to let them go for $9,That sounds like a fair price.  Would you like the chairs in red or green?
red,excellent.  happy to put in you these chairs today!
"Hey there. This is a nice looking piece - I'm pretty interested in buying it. I think your asking price is kind of high though, I'm thinking more like $350",I can definitely do $350 for it if you can stop by and pick it up from me.
It's a deal! Let's do it.,"Awesome, Ill get it ready to be moved out, and I'll be expecting you sometime today to pick it up. Cash only im afraid. Thanks so much for being reasonable!"
Hi is the washing machine still avaible?,"Yes, it is. For $100."
"Ok, the description is pretty vague can you tell me about the machine, why are you selling it?",There's nothing wrong with it if that's what you're wondering. We just got a new two in one washer/dryer and we didn't need this anymore.
Exactly what I was wondering. Well I'm in dire need of a machine and need one today. Do you deliever?,"Yes, but with delivery I can't budge from $100"
What if I come pick it up from? I can give you $80,Sounds fair enough.
"Hi! I'm interested in your amp and speakers, but since the CD player doesn't work, I'd like to offer $45 cash.",well I do want to get rid fo them quickly. can you come and pick them up?
Sure! Anywhere that's convenient for you.,Do you know the music loungeon 23rd street?
Yes. I'll meet you there tomorrow at 6pm?,I think I can do that.
Sounds great! I have been looking for a bike but that seems to be a bit pricey for what you are offering,This is almost 50% off the original price! And don't forget it comes with a nice lock so it doesn't get stolen!
I am willing to pay $100 for it since I have another offer I am looking at!,Would you be able to meet in the middle at $150?
Ill pay $135 and even come and pick up the bike from you.,Just for you you've got yourself a deal!
Yes i am I would like to check what is the lowest you will accept,I am looking to get around $6400 for her. There are no issues and it has one of those snazzy Aux ports all the kids rave about.
I love the aux ports do it have any scratches or marks?,"Nothing major, Just the small little scratches here and there. Hardly noticable. they will buff right out."
Can i pick it up today?,"Sure, why not. Do we have a deal on $6400?"
"Hi, I'm interested in the IKEA chest.  How much are you looking to sell it for?",I am selling it for $35.  I paid about $100 for it new.  It's in great condition.  Do we have a deal for $35?
"How about if I take it away for you, since you're moving, for $20.  Deal?",I really need at least $30 so I can make it worth my while.  Deal?
Can you throw in the flowers pictured and the balloons for $25?,"If you can pay $30, I will throw all of that in.  Deal?"
"Hi there, yes, your property seems to have some of the features that I'm looking for.",I am asking $3000.
That is a little steep for my current budget. Is there any chance you'd be able to come down a bit?,"It is a great deal, as a 2 bdrm home in the Upper Diamond District.  A great, friendly neighborhood, convenient to lots of bakeries, restaurants, Montclair Village, parks.  Also, easy access to highways 580 and 13."
"I know, it's a great location. Would you consider a $300 price break if I was to take care of the lawn care and yard maintenance?",Yes.
That's fantastic. I think I could swing $2700. Would you accept that offer?,Yes
Great! Pleasure doing business with you!,"you, too!"

"ah ok the website is messed up./ i had to oquit out of my earlier session, and then you came in. i guess we have to quit this and see if it takes us to the survey page, if not we have to see if it finds us a new partner.",gotcha
"Actually yes,  I am moving to the area from NYC and need a place to live and this seems to be a possible goo deal.","So the deposit is 1500, the rent is 2950 a month"

How about $60 and I'm on my way,We have a deal.
Hello,I suppose you are interested in this stunning Samsung Gear S3 Classic?
Yes I am interested in it. Is this a used or a new watch?,It's actually brand new. I got it as a gift and I never used it because I already have one. It's still in the box and everything. Never even opened it! The price is $275!
Does it still have the original warranty information and is it transerrable?,"Yeah, it does."
I meant transferrable obviously. Since it was a gift and you didn't pay any money for it would you accept an offer of $250?,"Hmm, I don't know. Retail for these is $299. I'm already dropping it quite a bit by going to $275. I'd be willing to drop it to $260 if you are paying cold hard cash."

hi,you're interested in the file cabinets?
"yes, but was thinking more in the range of $40. Are you willing to negotiate on price?","Maybe a little, I'd need to get more than $40 though. How many do you need?"

Awesome. Is there any rust or noticeable damage on the frame?,No rust. Overall the bike is great condition. It does need a new innertube
"Great. Since I'm going to have to end up buying a new inner tube, would you let the bike go for $76?",It is quite a unique bicycle. You can fold it up and put it in a bag. I was hoping to get at least 90 dollars.
Hello.  How are you?,Good thank you for asking and yourself?
Good!  Thx for asking.  I am interested in your nightstand!  CAn you tell me a little bit about it?,Sure its a pretty piece. Its all glass and mirror like type. It has a slight damage and the drawers have become hard to open due to its time.
Ok.  Does it have any other flaws?,No that's about it. I am taking it out at $75 and its reasonable considering what you're getting
Ok..  I could come pick up today and have $67 cash in hand right now.,Deal sounds great!
Awesome!  Thx so much!,Sure!
Yes.  It looks like a great car. I actually have a 2002 BMW X5 SUV that has all wheel drive.  I would be willing to trade you that plus $5000 cash.  This way you get a great running truck that can handle the mountains and some cash in your pocket.  Deal?,It sounds good but what's the condition of the suv?
The SUV is in great condition.  I had new tires put on last winter.  I have a Carfax report so you can see that it hasn't had accidents.  The main reason I want to get rid of it is because I want better gas mileage with a car rather than an SUV.  So do we have a deal for $5000?,Make it 5900 + the suv and we've got a deal.

Great. What's the reason why you are trying to get rid of it?,I am a dealer and I want another driver to have a great experience with this car.
I see. How many miles are on the car?,"170,000 and such 5700 is a more than fair price."
That's quite a bit. Are you willing to negotiate for a lower price?,of course. what is your budget like?
I've been looking for a car ranging from 2.5K to 4K. I am looking at a few other cars too. Would 3K work for you?,I will need 5000 to part ways with this one. But what we can do is that i can get 1000 down from you and the rest can be paid monthly.
"How about $3500 in cash today. If there are no issues after 3 months, I'll give you an extra $500?",I just don't see it my friend. I cant make money off of that. It is in great condition. Ready to go. 4500 would be where we need to be at.
"Sorry, that's out of my budget. I'll check out the other cars I had in mind. Thank you for your time.",Good luck.

Hello I am interested in the iPhone 6.,What questions do you have not covered by the ad you would like to ask?
Hello. Please let me know how old the apartment is.,It's been recently updated and painted. We do require a bit of information as well as a deposit if you're interested.
I understand. Is it in a decent neighborhood?,It's in one of the nicest parts of Pleasanton. We are offering it at such a reasonable price because we are hoping for long term stable renters.
Thanks! Wolud you be willing to accept $875 for it?,afraid we can't possibly go that low. It doesn't even cover our payments.
What's the lowest you could go?,We might consider $1500 and cover your utilities if all your references check out.
I couldn't do $1500. Would $1350 work for you?,No sorry. You will just have to keep looking. We had already reduced the price too low to start with.
How about $1490?,"Okay, we can go with that."
Hello. Are the chairs still available?,Definitely!
Great. What condition are they in?,"They're in pretty good shape. We used them in our dining room, but we only ever ate there for special occasions; Christmas, Easter, etc."
Sounds good. I see you have them listed for $150 but would you take $75 for them?,Sorry mate. I can go a bit lower but not that low. I was thinking closer to 125.
"I understand. I can't do $125, but would $120 work for you?",120 seems fair.
did you accept the offer?,Hello. Can you say your offer again?
it was $20 dollars and you were going to deliver.,I am sorry. This is a great item and it could not be on this price any way.
That was your offer earlier,I am selling MC-2205 stereo power and amplifier

"Okay. If subletting is allowed, I'd be okay with the asking price per month.",SO how much are you willing to pay for it?
Hi. I am interested in renting your apartment but can't quite afford the asking price. Is there some way I could do some work on the property to get the price around 1300?,"Hello, With all the lovely amenities and floor plan I am afraid I can not go that low. I could do $2,000 and one months free rent."
I think that is a fair price that is right around the middle of both our offers. Especially with the free rent included. You have a deal.,Thank you. Enjoy your new appt.

"Hello, what condition is you bike mount in?","It has only been used a few times, so in really great condition still."
That sounds good. How long have you had it?,I have had it just over seven months.
Okay. That's not too long. I'd like to buy it from you for $7 since it has been used.,that is less than half of asking...
"I realize that but I'm site unseen. For a used object, I think that is fair.","Well I really do want to make a deal with you , but you need to come up a little in theprice, it is almost brand new."
The best I can do is $9 if you're willing to hold it for me for 2 days while I wait for my paycheck.,I suppose I could do that. 9 sounds fair enough
"HI! I am interested in ;your home theater package, why are you selling it",Hi I am moving away so I just need to get rid of it that's why I decided to sell it

Hi. I am interested in purchasing this bike. Can you tell me a little bit more about it?,"It's been a good bicycle, I used it a few times in high school and then hit a growth spurt, so it's now a little too short for me."
have you used it a lot?,"For te first month or so, yes, but then grew six to seven inches and the frame was too small. Bought it on Craigslist six months ago. Just trying to recoup some of what I paid for it."
okay. I would like to get it but the price is way way high for me. Is there anything we can do about it?,"I'm flexible to a degree on the price. It is a Trek bike and they are known to be high quality bikes, though. What are you thinking?"
how about $85?,"No, that is way too low. I'd go maybe $120 and be willing to drive it to your home."

Since there is no picture of the chest I have to go on your word. I'd be disappointed if it was in worse shape than you described after driving down to see it. If you can drop the price to $99 I'll purchase it no matter the condition.,"I'm sorry I can't go that low. You're welcome to check it out and make your decision, but I assure you, it's in great shape. I'm willing to lower the price to $159."
How about we call it at an even $150 and we have a deal?,"I can do that, if you can purchase it today."
Yes I am.  It looks like a nice tablet. How old is it?,Only around a year old. They haven't even came out with a new model yet.
Does it come with a warranty?,It has about 3 months left on the original warranty. The battery life on it is excellent. Well worth the $200 asking price.
Did a child play with it?,No. I am retired and have no grandchildren. It was mainly used to look up recipes on pinterest.
"May I ask, why are you selling it?","My eyes just can't handle the screen. I had to get one of those laptop things. Amazing how far technology has advanced. I paid $325 originally, so I think this is a fair price."
I can get a new one for close to the same price you're asking.  Will you take $90?,"Oh my, no. I have had a few people offer me $175 and I turned them down. I have an extra case and some new screen protectors, even an extra charging cord. It really is a good deal."
"If you can ship it to me and include those accessories, I can go to $125 paid immediately.","I can ship to you but not for less than $150. Shipping is awful expensive and the extra packaging it would require. And then you would want it insured. And I don't drive, so cab fees. So much extra."
Well then $150 seems reasonable.  I can manage that.,Ok. I guess so.
"yes I am, can you tell me about the bike?",Well it's a great downhill racing bike. I'd be keeping it but I got into a motorbike crash recently and can't use it anymore. It's decked out with all the top quality gear
"huh, shame you've gotta sell it. What price are you hoping for?",Was hoping for something around 800 dollars but it's really no use to me so I'd be willing to go lower
how does $720 sound?,"Hmm, if you pick it up then sure."
Hello. Is the home still available?,yes
We have to negotiate...,i cant go any lower than 4750
"Woah no way, these are $5 on amazon. The best I can do is $6.","But on Amazon, you have to deal with waiting, and possibly paying for shipping. I'll work with you though since I am trying to sell quickly. 7.50?"
"Ok, but only if you ship it first and I'll mail you a check.","Works for me, thanks."
"Before I accept, is there a warrenty?",Its a used item but it has the standard manufacturer warranties if they apply.
"Hey there, I just saw your post about the tablet you are listing.","Yes, I have the Zte max pro with metro."
"I saw that your asking price is really close to the price of one brand new, could we work something out to make this price a little closer to $60?",60 is a little low considering its still in great condition and I haven't had it very long. How about 80?
"I can go $80, if you can deliver it.",I would love to deliver it. We have a deal!
What's the mileage? Are you the original owner? does it have a clean title?,125K. Clean title and Carfax.
"Nice, okay. It's hard to tell from the picture is it an extended cab?",Yes. Oversized exverything and many extras. When you can you pick it up? Cash only.
"I can pick up today but there is a withdrawal limit at my bank so I can pay you in cash today but only for $8,000","Well, call the bank and tell them you need 8 today and five tomorrow."
"You seem in a  big hurry to sell it and I was actually looking for a double cab. I can do the extended cab and get you the money tomorrow but I'd like it for 10,000","It's a 4-door. Too many unserious inquiries. Gimme $8,000 cash and a cashier's check for $2,000."
"Yes, I'm interested in your Cummins. It looks pretty big with that tool box.",Yes it also has some new parts and work been done to it in i reduced the price. It is in excellent shape.
And all the tools come with it?,Yes and the dually comes with it. You can't beat this sale.
I am very interested and have cash on hand but would you be willing to go for $10350 if I moved quickly on this?,Yes if you can come before 6 pm today.
"Yes, what condition is the bike in?","The bike is in great condition and there is nothing wrong with it, what does your budget look like?"
Not sure. How long have you had it?,"I have had it for less than a year, it is 15'' and has 21 speeds with a grip shift"
Can I give you $75 cash? I'll come pic it up myself.,I was hoping to get closer to 150 for the bike but I can go down a little if you're willing.  How does 125 sound to you and I can throw in some stuff like a seat cover and bike lock for you?
$100 maybe? I don't need that extra stuff. I just need to get it for my kid.,"I see, okay I am willing to let it go for 100, thank you."
I'm doing well thank you. How are you doing?,"I am great, am in a hurry to sell my frameset.  Do you have questions for me on it?"
"Yes actually, has it ever been used? What kind of condition is it in?","It has been used, nearly new and fits someone from 5 feet 3 to  5 feet 6 inches. It has not been in a crash and I dont have room for it anymore. $590 is what I am asking."
Okay cool. So would you be willing to go down to 300? I've seen these priced on ebay for about that much.,"That may be too low , but I would consider $450 if you come pic kit up today.  At this point I want to jsut get rid of it as fast as possible."
"Hi! It does look nice. The price seems a bit high for the unassembled bike, though. I would pay $25 cash and pick it up anywhere that would be convenient for you.","well we have two, one is assembled and the other is still sealed in the box, neither has been used before. id really like to try and get back close to what i paid for these. are you looking for one or for both?"
I was offering for only the unassembled one in the box.,"ok then, although they are no trouble at all to assemble, how does $37 sound?"
"still a bit high. would you take $30? every time I assemble something, it turns out to be difficult for me :)","$32 and you got a deal, we can even meet closer to where you live"
Hi can you tell me a little about the bike you are selling?,"It's a vintage, one of a kind. We actually had it assembled by hand with performance parts, it's definitely a special bike for enthusiats."
My son would love this bike! Are you willing to come down on the price at all?,"I'm willing to negotiate, but I don't have too much wiggle room on it."
"I would like to offer $300, how do you feel about that?",Can you meet me halfway on the price? $330 and I'll even throw in the spare tire I have for it.
At the price of $330 could you drop it off at my house for me?,"Sure, as long as you're local."
"Wow, that seems kind of expensive. And how much is the parking?",The parking is an extra fee of 150. I can give you the parking for free and the unit I can reduce to 1550.
How many square feet is the apartment?,It's 1100 square feet
"Well, what's the neighborhood like?","It's quiet, but a couple blocks down there's a small shopping center with a market and other stores."
"Well, I think the best I could do for an 1100 square foot apartment would be $750",750 is far too low.  It's going for 1583. 1440 with free parking
"Well, I'd really like to pay $949, but I'd be will to pay a little bit more if you can offer me some other perks.","Okay. Here's my final offer. Free parking, 1st month free, $100 deposit and $1300 for the unit. Sound good?"
"Yeah I'm super excited to finally get one, can you tell me about yours?","It's in great quality, though it's quite old and I'm not sure of the specs"
Well in that case I can't really offer that much for it,"That's fine, anything around 100-150 dollars would work"
hey there!,Can I answer any questions for you?
yes how many owners has this car had,I am the original owner on it.
I really want to buy this car for my boyfriend but I do not have the full amount I have $6250 cash right now,"I am sorry, but that is too low.  This has brand new tires and wheels with low miles.  Clean title and smogged ready.  All oil changes and tune ups have been up to date and maintained.  The lowest I could go is $10,000."

"okay, your price is a bit high for an older model phone. Would you be willing to take 200?",200 is a bit too low. Would you be able to go up to 225 at least?

Hello.,Hello to you friend
"Yes, I'm interested in this dresser from your ad?","Well its a great set, the night stand is included with the price. Now I do need this picked up by Sat. will that work for you?"
"Well, the ad says it's missing a handle, is there anything else wrong with it?","It's true the handle is unattached, but as it also states the handle is with the dresser. There are a small number of beauty marks from regular use, but other the the handle, no noticeable damage."
"Well, I'm interested, but considering the need to repair the handle, I'd like to pay $75.","That is less than I paid for the night stand alone, that is unacceptable. If the handle is a concern, I can however lower the total price to 175."

amazing thanks!,no problem
I am interested in this. Its just wow. Can you tell me about its location?,Absolutely! It's on 3185 Garrity Way in Richmond. It's got beautiful views of the bay and is around a lot of community activites. You can find nature here and you're only 7 miles away from some giant shopping areas. It's the best of both worlds.
That's good and is it fully furnished?,These are partially furnished and fully renovated units.
Great. I am really interested but the price is just holding me back,I am willing to give you some wiggle room as long as it's reasonable. Also if you sign a longer lease agreement I can move the price down a bit.
Would you be willing to accept 2097?,I think we could easily make that work.
Great! So deal?,Yes! You've got yourself a deal. Enjoy!
Hi how much is the bike,It's $35

"I think that's still too high. I might be willing to do $2,500","Tell you what, There's a small tear in the ragtop, I'll have it re-upholstered like new for you, and do the sale for $3000, does that sound fair?"
Okay I can do that,Great

"I agree with you about the location and architectural features; however, I think $1900 might be too steep of a price.  Can you do anything to get the price lower or maybe throw in some perks?

I believe the service is valued at more than I have but if I do $40 I would not be able to afford my sons diapers as well. I believe your service is worth more and if I had it to offer I most definitely would,I am sorry to hear about your predicament. Could you buy a smaller pack of diapers and pay $30?
"He is a big boy and the only ones they have are the small pack and it is 22.97, if you can work with me with the last $3 I would be forever grateful and make sure to tell my friends what a wonderful service you provide","Okay, but tell your friends that you paid $50."

That makes sense. What color is the frame itself?,It is black.
"Perfect, I would be willing to pay $12, since brand new ones are $15.",I might be willing to go $15 since this one actually cost more than $15. It has added features that some do not have.
"Since it does have some additional features, I think I can swing $15.",Sounds great. Thank you for being a good buyer!
"Hello, how are you?","Hi, I want to sell these speakers. Thy're in great condition, never been opened in fact. I'm knocking $10 off the original price of $30. And, I'm good, thanks."
"$30 seems a bit high, as I've seen quite a few go for less on eBay. Would you consider $10?","I really wouldn't, I think you can throw in a few more dollars for a new item."
Even considering this is what they are selling for online?,"Yes, because then you have to pay for shipping. $13 and it's yours, that would be the shipping cost."
"I'll split the difference with you, and offer $11.50. If not, I'm sorry, but I think I'd be paying too much.","I'll do $11.50 just because I don't have the time to find another buyer, thanks."

How many speeds does this bike have?,Hi. It's a fixed gear.

Hi there.,Howdy! Are you interested in the speaker set?
I am good.  And yes I am.,Excellent! What questions do you have about what's listed here?
Are you the original owner?  What is the condition?  How old is it?,I am the original owner. I've had it for quite some time so it's certainly had its use. There are some very minor cosmetic flaws but the sound quality and functionality is 100%! I don't recall the original manufactured date of this specific model but I can tell it was engineered to last.
Awesome.  I want it.  I could come and pick it up today.  I have $28 cash in hand.,"I appreciate that offer but I really need to get at least $35 out of it. I'd be happy to include the deck stand with it all. After all, it looks good with the rest of the set."
Right now I can only do $32.  Would that work??,"Well, considering I've had the listing for awhile, I'm also ready to get this thing to a new home so that we can move. That will work!"
"quite a home you got there. yes, i would like to rent this",so glad to hear that! What do you think of all the amenities it comes with?
They are adequate. The outside looks good.,Yea it's a great place to live. 3000 in this area so close to the freeways and so many stores is a great deal. I know it's going to rent quickly.
A lovely home but I was hoping you could go down a bit. I was thinking 2700.,totally understandable. I am open to making a deal for this property but I think 2700 is lower than what I could get from someone else. I like you though so let's make a deal we are both happy with. I could go to 2900
Well i appreciate that you are willing to work with me. I will settle for that fair price. 2900 will work.,i submitted 2900
"hello,I am intrested in buying this paino from you,how old is it",It is fairly new.
"even though it is newer,the most I can give for it would be 135","If I include the stand, a bench and sustain pedal, and deliver it to you, could you give me $344?"
no there is no way for that price. a new in the box one with all of the thing you are giving is 375. I will go as high as 150 and I will pick it up,No I can't give it to you for half price. It is new and includes extras.
what is the least you are willing to take for it,$300
still way to much how about 170,That's too low still.
ok so then we cant make a deal,"I guess not,"
"Hi, I'm great, Are the chairs new?",No they're not new. But they're not that old either. They are in good condition and very strong quality.
Since they're not new and you want to take them off your hands I can do 40,Yeah works for me. You will have to come get it though.
"Sure, sounds fair",okay then thanks!
Hi! I'm interested in your watch.,"Hi, that´s great! it is a very functional watch, I really enjoyed having it, very usefull , the watch is in perfect shape and I am including the wireless charging base"
How long did you have it for?,12 months
And what color is it?,"Black, if you are interested I can offer you free shipping"
"hey, I definitely am, it looks great","Thank you, it is high quality, very clean, and has not been exposed to smoke or pets."
Is it possible for you to deliver the sofa set?,Yes I can.
"$1,200. lets do it",Could you do $1230/
"Delivery costs would be more than $60 usually, right?",I believe so.
"I can definitely do $1,220, that fits my budget nicely",Ok that sounds good.
Hey I really want that bike but it seems a bit to pricy mind if we talk about it?,"Sure, I will answer any questions you have."
Well I get you upgraded it and its a 2017 model but how used is it?,I only used it a few times. I really do not have time to ride it due to my job.
ok that's fine and how are the tires and current chain,Both are in excellent condition. Not a scratch on the bike.
Ok well im working with a budget of 684. Now i should remind you this is still a used bike and even with your upgrades it wouldn't push it too 900 I could get a completely stock bike for 779,"I am actually taking a loss asking the $900. I am willing to negotiate on the price, however, I cannot go that low."
Well yes selling this.  Bike without much use.  Is certainly a loss for you but i did my reasearch and your exact model and your upgrades have gone down in price when bought brand new now a brand new bike with those up grades would run me about 820 so that would certainly mean your bike value has significantly reduced. If 684 is too low I can do 699 and i will pick it up,This bike was only used three times and it has been parked in a garage. It is very clean with many upgraded parts. I could do $790 and I will deliver it to you.
How about 740 with meet me halfway delivery,I can do $750 with meeting halfway for delivery.
745. Sound good that's really the best I can do,"Okay, you got yourself a deal."
"Hi, I am interested in this house.",Hi there - I'd love to sell it to you.  Make me an offer!
The price seems high compared to others in the area of this size. Would you accept $1325?,I can't go that low.  I can offer you $2200 and a free 5 year home warranty that covers everything.
I can't go above 2000. Would you take 2000 and no warranty?,Done!  Thanks for your business!
The armoire looks pretty nice.,It's in pretty good condition.  The handle on the right door is missing. That's the only thing wrong with it.
I'm sure it will take time and money to replace the handle.  I would like to pay $30.,The handle doesnt cost much to replace.  Home depot has something similar for cheap. How about 35?
"I hope you're correct, but it will still take some time. I will also need to get it installed, I'm not good with tools.  Let's make it 32 dollars.","Okay, you have a point. 33 and it's a deal."
I will agree to $33 if you can deliver it.,Delivery? That's a bit extra. I would expect you to come pick it up.
"I don't have a vehicle.  I would have to rent something.  I will cost much more.  If I have to pick it up, I will pay $30.  If you deliver it, I will pay you $35.",I'll deliver it and accept the 35
does this bike have scratches?,Very light scratches from normal use.
are the tires the originals or are they new?,Original tires
Going great!!! So is the Camaro an automatic or manual,Its a manual 2010 and has zl1 rims
Awesome.  How is the interior holding up?,"Its super clean, 120 miles only. im looking for 14800$"
Is the title clear and if it is when can I come pick it up?,"Title is clean, you can come tomorrow at 8am"
Hi I'm interested in the bike.,excellent it is in excellent condition
Do you have additional information about it?,24 pounds. shimano deore xt crankset. egg beater pedals disc brakes. rock shoc racing forkds. ritcher comp handlebars and stem. indeed this bike is state of the art.
I would give you 500 for it in cash. I'll pick it up and get it out of your hair,800 I'm afraid. i am very fond of this bike and i am not eager to just give it too anyone.
I'm afraid that's a bit too much for what you are asking for. I think 560 would work well.,I am not eager to see it go for 560. This is a great MTB. But i will part with it if you are willing to get to 680 but that is the absolute lowest.
I think 640 would be the highest I could go,hahaha. let us meet in the middle to 660?
"Hello, I am looking at your apartment on Allston Place, I like it a lot!","That's good to hear! We actually have a lot of interest in this unit currently, are you interested in leasing today?"

"Ok  that sounds great, I will see you in about an hour with the cash.",see you then
Are you offering this bike in one color or all three for the listed price?,Just blue for this one.
"OK, how old is it?","It's like brand new. Never used. We bought it then decided to move, and want to sell it rather than take it with us."
"Sure, I just wonder how long you owned it?",We've only had it for about two weeks and have been busy getting ready for the move. It was a short notice thing right after we bought it. So it just been sitting in the garage since then.
"Ok, would you accept $150 for it?",Can you make an offer a little closer to $200?
Could you deliver it if I pay $200?,"Sure, if you're within 25 miles of us."
What city are you in?,That's a good question. I think I'm in the same town you're in. So it's just a matter of how far out of town do you live?
I'm downtown,"That's great, cause I just 5 miles from town. Deal. Send through the offer and I'll accept it."
Hi do you have this phone only in black?,Yes. Only in black. But it has the case and protective cover.
The listing mentions it as brand new. Is it brand new? that is not unopened?,It's been opened. Taken out of the bo but it's never been used. It was bought as a gift for my new daughter-in-law but she already had a phone she was happy with.
I see. The amount mentioned is not making me happy :(,I agree. These smart phones have gotten completely ridiculous but I'm already taking a loss.
How about $210?,Can you do $250?
"I am, but I'm unable to afford what you're asking. Are you flexible on the price?","Somewhat, we offer a lot of great amenaties that really help you to get your money's worth"
"Well I certainly appreciate that, but with my income, I'm unable to afford your asking price, regardless of amenities.",What price range are you looking at here?
howdy. so moving eh?,Yes. I'm selling my bed for $200.
"200 is a bit out my price range. tell you what, i'll give you 100 for it and i'll come and pick it up","Sorry, I want at least $150 for it."
i see. 150... well does it have bed frame?,"Yes, it comes with a bed frame and a mattress."
"ok, then tell you what. if you deliver it for me for 150, we have a deal",$150 and you can pick it up. $160 for shipping.
"now if I have to come and pick it up, let's do 140 for the whole thing",Fine.

whats the lowest you would take,"I would really like the full asking price of $650, but can consider an offer, if it is reasonable, and if I know it is going to a good home."
I can afford $375,Oh. that is far too low. This is a well maintained bike. Very expensive to buy new. I would be willing to do $575.
that sounds like a good price but im scrapped for cash i can do $%) and pick it up,"I'm sorry. I can even throw in 2 certificates for bike upkeep at the local bicycle shop. But, I can't go lower than $550, you will have to come up in price."

"Hi. Yes, it's a nice bike but it's kind of old.",True but I just had it tuned up. My asking price is $400 but it's negotiable.

Hi I'm interested in this home and would like details.,"Hi how are you doing today? The full details are listed in the description, but I would like to add that this home was well loved, passed down from my parents. I grew up here & it is a very lovely home. Low maintenance, peaceful neighborhood and great neighbors!"
"The house sounds great, but the list price is a lot higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you take 1700?",Hmmm... This house already listed at a huge discount & also a very affordable value for all that is offered with this property.. I would be willing to drop the price as low as $2400 if that sounds more suitable for you?
That's still a little high I think. I'd be willing to do $2200 if you take care of utilities.,I think I can agree with those circumstances. So $2200 + utilities it is then? I would just like to confirm before starting my paperwork & removing the sign from the far corner or the yard. Thank you
Yes we have a deal!,"Thank you, it's been a pleasure. I will start on the paperwork now to begin closing on our deal. Thanks again & have a great day!"

"oh, ok, do you offer a warranty of any sort?",Cash and carry.  You pickup.
I'm thinking $30 is a fair price,It cost me $30 to bring it here.  I can't accept anything less than $75.
"Well, $45 means you still get a pretty good profit. How about that?","This is  a 6' tall, oak wook bookcase with 2 glass doors and shelves on the interior.  $75, take it or leave it."
I know it is a great bookcase but it isn't new. It is used. That should make it cheaper...,"I've dropped the price by $20 so if you want it it will cost you $75, if you don't I need to check someone else who wants to pay my original asking price.  Do you want it at $75?"

Are the tires new?,"the tires on it no,but i will include he maxxis detonator tires and they are new"
Hi I am interested in the 2 bedroom apartment you advertised,"Great! It's a beautiful place. Very close to the university. 2nd floor, right next to the laundry room"
The pictures imply that it's currently empty. Do you know if the previous owner was a smoker?,"No, It's a clean room in a great building. Lists at $2600 a month, and it won't stay empty for long"
"The ad states that the bathroom is ""newer"" with granite counter tops. how new is ""newer?""",I had the bathroom redone about 2 years ago. They still look great!
"Hello, I am doing well. I am interested in your Toyota. What condition is it in?",Great condition.  All maintenance has been up to date and just passed SMOG check.  Super clean inside and out and clear car title.
Awesome. I see you have it priced at 5700. I'm a college student and definitely in need of it. Could you possibly do with 4700?,"I could do $4,950.."
yea its close to Metro which is noisy because of public transit. i would like to see if you can do bettr on the price,i can offer you a deal of 2500 for the best comfort in your life
"How about you remove the high speed internet, all appliances and the dishwasher and crown molding and i pay 1700",lol remove  you can give me 2399.99
sorry i cant afford that right now. I just need the home i dont need the stuff in it. How about you hire someone to remove the stuff and i pay for removal and you give me the place for 1550,price removal 1200 and then 1550
what do you mean ? so you will give it to me for 1550 if i pay the 1200 to remove the stuff in the place ?,yes total 2750
Ok 1550 but i pay 2750 ?,amount entered would be 2750
Ok how about i offer you 1700 and you take it ?,yes
"yes, I am I actually love this type of car, I would like to negotiate the price","I have replaced a few items on this car, it only had one owner which was me, and it has less than 100,000 miles on it. What is your offer?"
i'm so vain. i'm pretty sure this ad is about me. is it?,"lol, no sir but i do have a beautiful white vanity for sale if you are interested."
i do love vanity. i'll pay as much as 65. we are talking about Vanity the girl that sang with Prince right?,lol no is there anything you would like to know about this piece?
i have been asking. my apologies if my curiosity doesn't align with your social mores. fine then. how deep are the shelves? *yawn*,they are 12 inches wide by 18 inches deep
okay. how is 70?,"I can do $70, when would you be able to pick it up"
hi. price is quite high but i like the apt.,"Your offer is too low, I can not accept it. I need at least $2600"
"Hello, I seen your ad online for the Buenos Aires bike and I was wondering if it were still available?",Yes it is still available. Its an amazing bike. 202 Lemond with upgraded and new parts
"I seen that. The frame looks like its in great shape. And I see you are asking $825 for it. But with my current budget, I am hoping you will consider $577.",$577 would be too low. How about $690. Its a great deal you wont regret it
How about $645 and I will pick it up and pay in cash today.,I guess we can do that. You have a deal
Yes I am. how old is it?,It is about 2 years old. But in great condition. It has been in an animal free and non smoking environment.
Yes but the price is way way way high for me. I am only a student and can only afford little.,I am open to offers.
I can offer $87 since you want to get rid of it and its two years old,That is really low but since I want to get rid of it quickly I agree. As long as you can come get it today.
"Doing great, how are you?","I'm doing good, I have a bike here that I'm trying to sell, are you interested?"
"It has definitely caught my eye. It's a little higher than my price range, but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle.",Yes I'm sure we can work something out as long as you can be reasonable.  The bike is really souped up and took alot of my time to customize!
I can definitely see that! Are there any other modifications other than the shocks and saddle?,"Yes, the cranks are updated and also the dropper.  The bike is so fast and so very light, you will love it!"
Very interesting. Does it come with any spare parts?,"If you're willing to come up a little I can throw in some extra things, what price did you have in mind?"
"Well I'll be honest, my price range is about half of what you're asking, but I certainly don't mind paying a little more for a good quality product.","right I understand, it is a super high quality product have no doubts.  Would you be able to pay 2500 if I can also throw in a spare parts kit worth 500-600 and then also will add a set of tires and wheels to go with them?"
"That's not unreasonable, but still a little high for me. Can you do 2250?","I can but will have to keep the wheels and tires but we could do that, do you want the offer?"
"Fair enough, I don't mean to lowball you. With the spare parts and extra wheels and tires, I can do 2500.",Okay thank you!
Hello how are you! I am interested in speaking to you about the Garmin Nuvi.,Great! It comes with lifetime traffic and works well.
I see it doesn't have a mount and is older technology.  Do you mind going to $14 for that?,I could accept $15.
"If I come pick it up today, would you accept $14",ok
"I am really interested in the bike you have for sale, is it in good working order?",This bike is basically brand new. I only ever rode it once!
"Yea, in the picture it really looks clean. Have any room on the price?",If you pay in cash I'll make a deal with you
I could offer you $210 cash in hand today.,Then the bike is yours!
"No probelm, thanks for posting. I could use all twenty five of these. Do I have to pick them up or are you shipping them?","You will have to pick them up. I have them listed at $200, but will work with you if you pick them up."
That works. I can come get them Saturday in the morning or Sunday afternoon if that's better.,Great. Would $170 work for you>
"I want two of them, anyway you can cut me a deal? I can come pick up",well sure I could knock it down to 55
I was thinking more of $45. How about we split the difference and go $50 each?,That is do able I could deliver them too you for the extra five though

I can do 17.,sold
"I am great thanks, Yourself? I am interested in the classic bike you have posted.",I'm good!  Ok great!  It's practically new.  Only has been used once for about 4 miles.  I'm asking #200
That is a bit pricey for me. It would be a gift for my daughter. Would you be willing to go $100 and I will pick it up? Perhaps I could help out with some work around your yard.,I could do $150.
Would you do $140 and a plate of fresh baked cookies?,That sounds great!  You have a deal!
"Yes I am, is it in a good neighborhood?","Yes its in a great neighborhood! Its got a pool, a clubhouse, security, trash compactor, stainless steel appliances, dishwasher, microwave, oven, laundry in your unit. Its 1 bath, 471 SQ FT."
This sounds like exactly what I'm looking for. Do you mind if I ask if there is a parking lot or is it on street parking?,"Hi, thanks for checking out this property! There are assigned spaces in a lot. Each unit has 2 assigned spaces and there is overflow parking for guests as well."
"Cool. Do you know if pets are allowed, cats and dogs I mean. I have two indoor cats that would be coming with me. Also is there a balcony or an outdoor space like a private patio of is there just the community space?","Yes, it is a pet friendly property. This unit does have a balcony and there is a community green space as well."
This sounds great. Could I get it for $1631?,"Oh I'm afraid that is too low for this unit. The bay views are breathtaking and you are steps away from shopping, dining and entertainment. This is a premium location so the lowest I can take is $2000"
I really love the apartment. It has everything I am looking for. I was hoping that maybe you would be willing to negotiate the rent price. It is a little more than I can afford. I am trying to pay off all my student loans and I don't want to be penniless at the end of the month,Thank you. The place is really one of a kind with many nice perks including parking and storage. $2550 is what I'm willing to offer you.
"I know.. It is a beautiful place. That is still more than I can afford. I would be willing to keep the grounds. I am an avid landscaper and very good at all types of gardening and maintenance. I also am a fanatical cleaner and home decorator. I would keep the place pristine. I don't smoke, have pets, or party. COuld you possibly give it to me for $1924?",Thank you it really is. That's still a bit too low. All bills are included. I'm willing to do 2350 a month and pay utilities.
"hello, is the device still available?",Yes it is. I'm asking $15 for it.
Does it come with a power cord?,Yes it does.
Would you accept $10?,"I'm sorry but I can't go as low as $10, as I'm asking for $15. Would $13 work for you?"
I could pay $13 if I we could meet in about 2 hours.,That would work. Deal!
I would love to have the phone but is it free from any financial obligations?,"Yes, you would have to set up an account with a provider after you purchase it."
"Since the phone says AT&T do I have to contract through AT&T ? If so why don""t we lower the price to 100.00 .","Yes it has to be AT&T if you keep it ""as is.""  However, I'm a hardware engineer and can unlock the phone for you!  That way you can set it up on any network.  For that I would ask $160."
I think that this acceptable.,"Great, I'll accept your offer!"
"Hello, I'm interested in this coffee table. What it is made out of? Is it solid wood or something else?","Yes, it is solid wood...dark cherry. It has a very subtle red undertone in the sun but is still predominantly cappuccino."
What kind of shape is it in? Are there any scratches or stains or any visible damage?,"Not a single scratch! I have been very careful with this piece of furniture, and I have no animals or children to mess with it! It is in excellent condition."
Sounds great! I'd like to make an offer of $106!,"hmmm, that is a little lower than I would like for it. I could probably go down to $125; or, if you don't live too far away, my Dad has a truck. For the full $140 he could deliver it to you."
I can do the $125 and I'll pick it up myself. How does that sound?,"Yep, that will work. Let me know when you want to pick it up."
I am interested in your bunk bed. Please tell me a bit about its condition.,They are in excellent condition as they haven't been used a lot. The mattress's are like new.
Was it new when you bought it?,"Yes, the bed's and mattress was brought brand new. They were for my grandkids to use while visiting."
What is the brand?,The mattress's are Sealy Posturepedic. I think the beds brand name is Ashley furniture.
What year was it purchased?,It was purchased in 2012.
Why are you getting rid of it now?,We are downsizing and selling what furniture we don't need.
What was the original purchase price?,The original price was $1200. I think my price of $290. is fair considering it still looks like new.
I will buy it cash for 200 and pick it up tonight.,I will split it with you for $240 and i will throw in the new sgeets also
Are the sheets in their original packaging,Yes they are.
$230 and you have a deal,I will accept your offer of $230.
"hello, I'd like to buy your Trek bike for $700!","I'm happy that you're interested, but with all of the upgrades I've put on it, I feel $700 is a little low"
"I fell in love with this sofa, unfortunately it is a little out of my price range. Will you be willing to cone diwn in price?","Hello, yes I am willing to negotiate. What is the best deal we can make today?"
"i can offer you $1,000 cash and i will pick it up.",I hate to let this sofa go! Also so you know it is very comfortable and spacious how about $1500?
"It is beautiful, but that is still a little steep for me.   I can give you 1300 by check.",When can you pick it up?
I can have my brother pick it up this Sunday.,"Sunday isn't great for me but I can rearrange some things,  and to hold it I am gonna have to ask can you pay $1350 ?"
"Sorry.  Not possible, i will pay when it is picked up.",Okay well today is tuesday if someone is willing to pay my price before sunday I would be crazy not to take it. An extra 50 bucks to hold it would be worth it to you.
"Thirteen hundred is the most i can afford.   No extra and no prior payment. If you think you can do better, do it","Okay, have a great day!"
Nice chair how old is this chair? Anything wrong with it?,There's nothing wrong with the chair it just won't fit our new living room area. The chair is less than one year old and it's in perfect condition.
"I have $37 to offer today, but I could go up a little more if there is a possiblity of me picking it up today.",This chair is worth at least $100 in this condition but since I really want to sell it if you can come and pick it up today I can let it go for $65

"I noticed that. I can pay 200 for it,",No way. I said pristine condition.
You are asking for 330. well i can come up to 250,I need more. It is still in pristine. Perfect condition. That is way less than a refurbished one with scratches.

Hi how are you!,I am great! Are you interested in the car?

You're only dropping it $100 more. I need you to work with me a little please.,"That's because your offer was too low to begin with. $2,400 do you have a counter offer?"

Fair enough.  I do like the older look.  How about $70?,I would not be willing to go that low. I could come down to $90.

Hello I was looking to purchase your sub woofer. You are asking $20 correct?,That is correct.
"I see it has no grill, It must be pretty used up. Would you do $14 cash if I came and picked it up tomorrow?",It is in really great condition. I could do $16 for the speaker.
Hello is anything wrong with this?,"One of the drawers can get stuck, and is hard to open, but that's it. Very sturdy."
If I pick it up would you be willing to lower the price?,Maybe. I haven't been including shipping in the price.
I'd really like to pay $180 for this if possible.,I can do $180. I appreciate you not starting with a ridiculously low offer.
Of course. We have a deal then?,Sure. $180 it is.
hello,"hello, what can we do to get you in this beautiful car today living and driving your dreams?"

I would be able to come by and pick it up or meet you at an agreed upon location to get the bike.",It is in excellent condition. $275 is about as low as I can go. Even today a compareable bicycle will run you over $1000 dollars.

How about $3500?,Okay. It's a deal
Hello,Hi there.  Are you interested in the car?
"Yes, very. It looks like it is in great shape. How are the seats? Any tears?","Not a one.  I keep 'er in great shape-- I hate to get rid of her, but I need the money."

And is it red just like in the picture?,"Yes it is exactly like the photo, practically brand new too!"

Would any type of services come with it?,"there is a full bath, and kitchen with stove, in a great location. i can throw in gas?"
hello,hi how are you doing? would you like to know more about this place?
"this is an interesting place, i'm an experienced renter, but $2200 seems a little high for the laurel area. Would you be willing to rent it to me for $1470? I have the deposit and first and last ready to go",That is a little too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to 2000? I will throw in free electriicty and water for the first 3 months

I saw your ad for the rental. I am interested but the price for that area is high. Is there some wiggle room there?,"sure, what price can you offer?"
"Well, other 4 bedrooms go for around $1400 but you do offer the bonus office room and it is newly painted exterior...... could you do $1600?","well, that's too low. the house has an amazing lake view"
"This is true, none of the others do......i could go $1750","Also, consider the spacious 2 car garage, completely new painting and epoxy flooring, and all the facilities that come with the community. I could lower the price to $2300, but not much lower."

That's a nice looking car. What kind of interior are you working with?,"It's a sleek black, I think it's upholstery, do you like it?"
It looks very nice but I'm worried about the engine. Have you had any accidents or major repairs done on it?,"Oh no way, we here at Best Auto Sale only resale cars like this one when the owner barely used it. I think the daughter of the previous owner dropped it off and sold it to us because her mother had died"
Well I guess that's a plus for me. The price is a bit much for me. Would you be willing to go for $8000,"I can do 9000, what's your budget?"
I was hoping for $8000 so that I can have some left for the insurance but I can pull all my pennies together for $8500,"thanks for working with me, don't mean to push you dear"
I've been looking at it. Why did the last tennant leave?,The last tenant left because they bought a home of their own.  We are actually running a special today.  You can secure the apartment for the discounted price of $1800 if you sign the lease today.  Are you interested?
"I am interested, but that price is too much for my family. We have budgeted for $1000 monthy rent. We can pay our deposit today if that monthly price will work for you.","We cannot afford to rent for $1000.  What is the absolute highest rent you can afford?  If you cannot afford more, then we cannot rent to you."
"We really like the home, and would hate to lose out on this offer. If you can include water and electric I can pay a total of $1500. The extra $500 will more than cover what we use, and would allow us to rework our budget to afford the higher rent.","I wish I could agree to that.  How about if I waive your security deposit and have you sign a 3-year lease.  This way you go into the rental with a bit of extra cash to allow you to reorganize your budget.  I can lower the rent to $1750 if you are willing to do this.  Water is included, but not electric at this price.  Deal?"
"That is much appreciated. We can almost fit that into our budget. If you can take an extra $50 off, bringing the total to $1700 per month, we have a deal.",Deal!
"Hi, I am very interested.  What color or the cases?",The LG v10 is flawless and running the latest android N
That's fantastic.  What colors are the cases?,I have a black leather folio case and a premium grey Otter box
Perfect.  I see that you want $200.  I can offer you $140 and pick it up asap.,I would but the accessories alone cost too much it would be like selling the phone for $60
What is the lowest you can go?,I can do $150 no accessories
"Hello there, I see you have a sectional for sale?",Yes I do. Are you interested? It is in great condition.
I need a new one for my living room. How much are you asking for?,I am asking $1495 for the sectional.

Hi thank you!  i am very interested in the phone you have for sale.  Is it still under warranty?,It's still for sell and it does have one year left on the warranty.
"That's great, I can give you $140 cash now and come pick it up wherever is convenient for you","I can't go as low as $140, as I need to get closer to the $200 listing price. Could you do $180?"
Do you have any screen protectors or cases you could throw in with it?  Does it come with charger and earbuds?,It will only comes with the earbuds.
Ok would you be willing to take $175 and throw in a case or screen protector?,I can't take $175 but for $188 I can throw in a case.
Hi I am interested in your bike is it still available?,"Yes, it is. I am asking 100 for it."

"Yeah, just starting up and looking to get some equipment. What condition is it in?","Great condition honestly, I think I only used it twice, if you want the manual and original packaging"
"Yeah I'd be interested in those extras. However, considering there's no software included and it will be tough for me to find it, would you consider lowering the price just a little bit?","Oh, by all means, what's your budget? I don't think I could justify going much lower than 35"
I think we can work something out. I was originally thinking 35 but since you're throwing in some extras how about 40?,37 for being so obliging
Hello. I'm interested in the ear buds you have for sale.,Hello!
"I've done a little pricing online. I know they're new, but it's a little higher than some stores. I'm willing to take them off your hands today for $2.",I guess $3 is not bad price. But I can sell it for $2.5
That's fair.,Deal
"Unfortunately, it looks like the system only lets us offer whole dollars, but i'll bring 50 cents with me when I arrive.",OK
"Hey there, im very interested in this place, what can you tell me about it!",It is a 2 bedroom apartment with a great view and a storage unit.  You also get all utilities included except for electric.  Are you interested?
"Hmm, yes that sounds wonderful. From what I've been reading the inside is quite nice too, with granite countertop and stainless steel appliances, a real modern look. Sounds like just what I need, plus the location is perfect. The list price however is a tad bit steep, could you possibly sell for $2000? That would be fantastic.","Unfortunately, $2000 is too low for a high demand apartment like this one.  I can bring the price down to $2500.  Can you do this price?"
$2500 would be reasonable if I didn't have to pay to move all my stuff. Would you be able to offer a free moving service if I paid the premium $2500 price?,"Yes, that sounds great.  So then we have  deal for $2500 per month.  I'll send you the offer now.  Thanks!"
"Hello, I am interested in the bike.",Do you have any questions about it?
"It seems like it's in great shape, but are there any issues with it that aren't listed? I am on a budget on what I can spend so I need a good deal please :)","None, at all. Like I posted it's all custom built and if you have issues you can bring it in and we'll fix it for you."
"Okay, sounds good. I would like to offer 485 for the bike. I know it may sell new higher, but even though it's a great bike, it's still used so more likely to have some issues pop up sooner.","Yes, not going to be able to do it at that price. The parts cost more than that."
"Well, as I really am on a budget, I can go up to 532, but that is really the most I can pay for the bike. I just can't afford a higher price.",The lowest I can go is 600.
Let's meet in the middle at 550 and that would work out well for both of us.,Ok that works for me. Thank-you.
"No, actually I am interested in the bike rack that YOU are selling.",That's exactly what I meant. I was guessing what you were going to say. Am I correct that you want to buy it for $45?
"Ah, you are very clever and somewhat psychic! LOL First, I was wondering if the box had any damage?","LOL. Long days. I tell ya. It doesn't, though! You can re-purpose the box however you seek fit. I could even deliver it."
"Trust me, I understand! OK, great! I'm short on funds right now, so any way I can talk you down to $30 if I come pick it up today, cash in hand?","I appreciate that. And just for being so human, $30 is great! :)"
Hello! I would like to buy this stereo for $59,"It is a Pioneer, and it is in great condition. I will accept $89."
"okay, I will pay $89","Ok, agreed. Thank you"
"Hi, your selling the Scion for $6415?","Yes it is up for sale, clean title, excellent running condition, no issues with the car.  air conditioning, USB AUX and MP3 as well included"
It's nice but it's nearly 10 years old. Would you be interested in something closer to $2500?,No this car is in mint condition. I could go $5800 but that is about it. The tires are even new on it.
That's too much than I'm willing to pay. Last offer of $3200?,That is too little.
I am trying to stay under $1400 but I can budge a little on the price. Does the property have a big backyard or a pool?,"No pool but if you can pay an extra 125 I can include a membership to the local pool which is very close, does that sound like a good thing to you?"
I do like idea of having access to a pool.,"Yea great and I hear that they are kinda private too so you don't have to worry about alot of nasty things like pee in the pool!  Also you asked about the back yard which is actually huge, would you need me to get the measurements for you?"
I don't need exact measurements. I just wanted enough space for my dogs to run around. I see there are a lot of appliances included. I could so 1500 if there is a washer/dryer already installed.,"Yes we can include the washer and the dryer.  I also would like to offer you some swimming goggles and suits and since you have dogs I could also throw in a dual doggy house for your backyard if you are able to pay just 50 more, 1550 total, what do you say?"
I like your lamp are there any scratches or blemishes?,no blemishes. it's in almost perfect condition
Sounds good...would you take 140 cash?  I could swing by and pick it up today.,you know what? that's a reasonable deal. sounds good.
"Hi, how are you?","I'm doing pretty good, yourself?"
"Well, thank you. I would like to purchase this bike for $140, do you accept? It is not in gread shape, and I don't even need the accessories.","The $200 was already discounted, due to not being in the best shape, so I would be losing a lot of money going that low. Would you be willing to pay $180? I will drop it off for you"
"HI, how old are these fitbits?","This one is new, we accidentally bought too many and my daughter didn't want it"
"ok, do you have the receipt to show?",*hands receipt*
"thank you. If I drive the 200 miles to pick it up and have cash, would accept $35?","No way, give me 50 and I'll mail it to you"
I cant do 50 unfortunately. These are on sale at walmart right now for 45. Would you go 40?,It includes 2 bands that the Wal-Mart wouldn't include. I'll give you 45. Deal?
Hello. Beautiful car!,"Thanks, it is a great little car."
What's the milage on it?,It only has 15k miles on it. I only drive it on weekends.
Are you the orignal owner?,"Yep, I'm the only owner and I've never let anyone else drive it. I've kept up on all the maintenance and have driven it very carefully."
Why are you parting with it?,I got a brand new one.
Nice! The price is a little steep for a 10 year old car and without warranty those german cars are expensive to work on.,Yeah if you don't have a good mechanic near you I guess that could be a problem. I've been lucky to have lots of great shops. I'm not in a hurry to sell it though.
How long is the warrranty on it?,I'm sure it is long expired. But I mean it is a Porshe. Not really a practical car.
For some it is. Would you take $40K for it?,No that is just way too low. This car is worth what I'm asking for it and I'm not in a hurry to sell it so I can't really justify such a low price. It's a great car in great condition. Has a Chrono sports pakage and full leather package. I can throw in the cover and a set of rims that I once bought for it but never swapped out on it. But I really can't lower the price that much.
If I was able to pick it up today would you go to $50K? I would also be paying in cash.,If you can pay in cash that is definitely a reasonable offer. I will be around today if you want to come check it out and give it a test drive.
"Hi, I am interested in the foot massage.  Does everything work on it?","Hi, are you interested in this item?"
Great!  I see you want $20.  I can give you $18 and go get it as soon as you are available.,i think I can lower the price to $18 if you would come pick it up asap! Are you available in about an hour?
I am! Are there any scratches or chips on the screen?,No it is clean and had a cover on it the entire time.  No scratches on phone or screen.  It is like brand new.
That's good to hear. Is there any wiggle room on the price?,Sure we can negotiate. I can do $230 cash if you can get it by 8pm tonight?
"Hi, Im good thanks. I'm really interested in your speakers. Do you mind If I ask a few questions about them?","absolutely not, go right ahead."
"Lol. How long have you had them, I'm trying to get an idea for the year they are from.","I haven't had them too long, maybe like 4 months and I've just also updated the foam that surrounds them so they are banging at the hardest possible!"
"Cool, I have a place all cleared out for them on a shelf in the living room but the shelf isn't adjustable. Can you tell me how tall these are, and about how much they weigh?",They are about 3 ft tall and then they weigh like 10-15 lbs a piece.  I also added polyfill enclosures so they are banging again - not kidding!
That's great. Could you part with them for $90?,That will work for me! I will send you the offer.
"Hi, I'm considering your offer for this estate, but it's slightly out of my budget. What makes it cost so much?","It's historically registered. It has some meaning to the community ad scholars. Plus, you get all three stories to yourself."
What's the area around it like?,"Downtown Livermore is a quaint village with character. Public transportation is nearby, and there are a lot of neat little shops."
That's nice. Is there any furniture included?,"The washer, dryer, and fridge are included."
"That seems a bit steep of a price for no furniture, I'd like to offer $1600.",That's way too low for me. I could do 1800.
You have to realize I'm going to have to buy all of my own furniture. I can't go higher than $1750.,"OK, I understand the burden of that. We can do a move in for June 1st for 1750."
"Hi, is this a top loader?",Yes it is a newer style top toader
how much,$99 It's Solid Oak and great condition
would you go any lower,"I could possibly go a bit lower, what were you thinking of?"
90 dollars,yeah I could do $90 for the bookcase. Could you pick it up today?
"Hi, I like this mirror. Can you tell me about how tall and wide it is?","It is a 3'x5' mirror. The top edge is 2"" but the depth is 1""."
Are there any cracks in the wood?,"Oh no. It is perfect. Very high quality made using sustainable practices,"
Would you be willing to take $120? I can come pick it up today!,"I was hoping for a little more, but if you can be here today, it is all yours!"
"Hello, I saw your listing and I'm interested. Are these used?","No. They ar enew out of box, although I do not have the original box they came in."
How does $100 sound for them?,I really cant afford to go that low. I can meet you half way at $150 and bump the warranty up to 18 months.
I'd really rather not pay more than $125 for these out of the box.,I can part with them for $125 if you can come pick them up by the end of the day tomorrow.
"I can do that, as long as I'm able to test if they all work before hand.",I will have them hooked up and ready to test when you get here.
Do you know how large the bedrooms are on your apartment?,"They are pretty large! About 14x14, each."
"Wow, nice. Does this unit come with the fireplace?","Yes, this unit has a very nice fireplace, as well as a decently sized storage space."
Okay! Sounds great. I'm hoping to pay a little less. Would you consider $1500?,"That's a little lower than I can go for this unit, because it is newly remodeled and very nice. I could go as low was $1700, though."
I might be able to go that high as long as the laundry facility is free of charge?,"Yes, the machines are key operated, and you will get a key with your apartment key."
Great! I'll take it for $1700.,"Sounds great, thank yoU!"
"Hello there, I am interested in your stingray bicycle, can you give me more information about it please","Yes, my grandpa brought it to use it but he gave it us but we really do not ride bike.  it is in working condition"
I am looking to buy this for my mom as she is looking to do some exercising and she mentioned bike riding. This looks perfect for her starting off,Yes this will be great for her
I'm on a budget though so I was wondering if the price was negotiable?,Yes it is
are you willing to accept $216 for the bike?,I was thinking about $220
$220 is not bad,You will love it!
"Hi there, saw your ad for the entertainment center. It looks like it's in good shape, how old is it?","It is in very good shape with only a couple of nicks on the top, as shown. It is about 2 years old."
"$250 seems a little high, I could get a brand new one for not much more. Would you take $180?","The price I paid was quite a bit higher, and it comes with an extra glass door. I would take $220, since it is in very good shape."
"How about $200, and I'll pick it up myself?",Sounds good!
"Yes I do but only have 90 dollars to spare, can you help me out?","If you can swing by today, I'll give it to you for 95 bucks."
Okay that sounds good,okay. it's a deal.
What year is it ??,2016. It's 100% functional.
"I like this phone , willing to pay $65 for this. Can you tell me more about it?","Ah yes, this iphone 5 is a matte black and is very nice looking"
Is there any wear and tear on it?,"Yes the screen is lifted in the corner, so you are going to need to fix it yourself"
Would you accept $65?,"That is way too low, I am sure you can find a much resonable price to repair the screen"
I think it would cost at least $50 to repair it.  My highest would be $90 tops.,Yeah that can be our final deal
200 dollars,Hi there - I am only asking 150 for this item.
"fine i'll keep the extra 50, i just like the quality","Yes, please buy your new baby something with the savings! Enjoy!"
Hi. I am interested in the apartment you have listed. Can you give me a little more information about it?,Well its a great place well designed and well lit
Are there any swimming pools? Any utilities included in the monthly price? How new is the unit?,No pools but we have a fitness center and we are close to a lot of entertainment venues. We have a pet spa and a fire pit for get together and of course the maintenance of all these amenities is included in the price
Is there any utilities included? How new is the unit? These were not answered in your above answer.,No utilities and the unit is only in its 5 th year however all appliances are upgrades and so are the fixtures so I can promise a fairly low utility bill in relation to your utility usage
"The monthly price is a bit steep, are you able to negotiate?",You know what normally i would say no but im gonna go talk to my manager and see what he say give me a few
"Okay, thank you so much.",Oh my God this never happens my. Manager is willing to waive your application fee and take ten dollars off your monthly rent with the first month free meaning you'll only have to pay 936 per month I swear this never happens and I have no idea what's gotten into him.
"While that is a great deal, is there anyway he would go to $800 a month with all the above terms. I am new to the area and things are a little tight right now. I would also be a long term renter.",I am really sorry. That's.  The most I've ever seen him do to be honest he normally maxes out at 5 off. I think with his current mood  i could get him to 926 and throw in a key to the gym
Do you think that you could talk him into $850?,no and.  I dont want to bother him too much or else his mood may go bad
"Awe, that is still pretty steep.",Give me another few mins ill grill him a little more
"Okay, thank you. I really hope you can get him down more. Like I said, I would be a long term renter and I pay on time every month.",ok so I spoke to him and he got a little annoyed but that may have worked in your favor he said 900 and that's it final offer
"Is all the above terms still apply to this offer? No application fee, and free first months rent and a key to the gym?",Why of course and i promise as soon as you move in you will see the value of the place
Is there any scratches or stains on these?,There are no scratches or stains of any kind on these. They are in great condition.
And you have two of them?,yes the price is for the pair of them together. :)
Would you be able to take 50 for them?,"That price is too low for me, they are in excellent condition so the listed price is already a good deal."
I know it's just a tight budget I have right now. I'd be able to go up to $58 if that's possible,Okay I can help you out a little. 60 and we got a deal.
HI I am interested in the theater seats what are you asking,"$1800. They are in perfect condition. Hardly ever used. No kids, no pets, non-smoking home."
How about 1600 if I can come right away to pick it up so its out of your way so you can get your newly decorated room,I have another buyer who has expressed interest.  They are willing to pay more than that and can come tomorrow morning.
"I will pay 1700 and can get it out of your way as soon as we are done talking, no need to wait till tomorrow ;)",$1700 works for us. Thanks!
hi i'm very interested in the car,"Hello, my list price is about $9000. It is a 2004 Lexus 300 with 4 new tires, clean title, and a smooth engine. I would prefer cash only."
that's high can we meet close to around $6500,"It's also got tinted windows, passed a smog test recently, and power steering. How about $7750?"
does the car have a clean title,"yes, it does."
i can do $7500 and pick it up if that's ok with you,"Sure, but call Pat first."
"howdy partner. nice space you got there. looks perfect for an artist studio. more than the office, though especially with all the sunlight",Thanks. It really is a great place for a studio or office. Are you interested in it?
"i sure am, but it's bit out of my price range. you said  there are two bedrooms? can we fit another person into the living area?","Yes, the living area is big enough for another person. What were you looking to pay?"
"my range is around 1600, but if I can have a roomate or two, then the price of the whole unit won't be that much higher than my budget. i would have to find the roomies first though","I understand. I can't do $1600, but how about $2300?"
"Hi, how big would you say this hutch is?",It is pretty big but beautiful and worth having
How long have you had it?,I had it a few months it is in great condition
Are there any scratches?,No scratches or marks at all
It sounds pretty heavy. I think I can get a truck to pick it up but I need to know about how much it weighs. Would you say it's larger than 3 feet acros and 6 feet high? I guestimate it about 140 pounds,It is about 115 pounds tops
So you think you could let it go for $75?,I would be able to do 100 the most because it is in great condition and pretty much never been used just was for display at home
"Deal, can I pick it up this weekend or do you need to get rid of it right away?",I can hold it for you!
"Yes, I definitely am!  I was wondering if you could go alitle lower in the price, maybe 10500?","Hmm, I am a bit flexible on the price, but this truck is in near mint condition."
What price were you thinking of?,"I think I would let it go for $11,200."
Hmm... Okay I guess I do that!  Thanks!,"Great, we have a deal then."
"Hello, I was interested in your Apple Watch.",Hi! I'm thinking $185. Does this price work with you?
Would you be willing to go lower? I could come pick it up this evening. How about say $170?,170 is perfect. I'll be available this evening for you to pick up
Hello,Hello How are you tonight?
"I am good and busy. Long day so far. So, I se you are selling this phone.","Yes it is a great phone in perfect condition, I just have no use for it."
Is it new? I am looking for a really good phone for work.,"It is not new but with the shape it is in, you would never know the difference."
Cool. I would like to take it off your hands. Is the price negotiable?,"I may have a little wiggle room, how much were you thinking?"
Can I pay 310 for it?,Well I would really like to get $325 out of it.  How does that sound?
How close to 1000 would you take?,"Hello. Wow, right to it. My kind of negotiation. I'd be happy at 1200. Lower than that I'd feel cheated. It's a really good bike. Do you have any questions?"
How long have you had it? Any wrecks or any damage to the bike?,"Nope, no accidents at all. Just normal use. Like I stated I work at a bike shop so I'm able to maintain it really well. It's mint."
Good morning. I'm interested in the apartment you have listed.,"Hi there! It is a great unit, very bright and freshly remodeled. Do you have any questions?"
How old is the complex?,"It is a bit of an older complex, but as I mentioned it is freshly remodeled. All new appliances put in along with fresh paint and new flooring."
That is a nice chandelier you have.,Thanks its great. Are you interested?
"Yes I am, is it very old? Does it have anything wrong with it?",Not at all. Its old that's why the price is 120.
Would you consider $60?,that's half of what I am actually asking. Sorry can't go so low. Its a very unique piece and its an oldie so definitely the amount doesn't justify that. I can accept $100
"As it is a timeless peace, I will go with $100. I am not sure I could find it for better. thanks! I will take the deal.",Great!
"How many miles does it have on it? You say ""had backup camera"" does it work?","There are 180,000 miles on the car, mainly highway.  It is a good runner.    It does have a backup camera, but only works when it wants to.   I don't use it often so I never got it looked at for repair."
I need something reliable. It does have a lot of miles on it. Mostly highway though. Would you accept 2100?,"It is a very reliable car.    It does have higher miles, however Toyota's are very well known for lasting.    I'm not able to accept $2,100, that is too low, less than half of what I'm asking."
"I will need to have some work done on it, it sounds like. Maybe an electrical problem somewhere. Its for my daughter, she's going to college next month. How old are the tires?","This would be a great car for her!    Tires I replaced about 3 months ago, and only have about 2,000 miles on them.   They are a very good all weather tire."
"I will need to have some work done on it, it sounds like. Maybe an electrical problem somewhere. Its for my daughter, she's going to college next month. How old are the tires?","I can't go that low, unfortunately.     The tires alone are practically new, and were $700 new.     I can drop it to $3,900."
Sweet. Okay. I can go as high as $2250. But that's really all I can afford at this time.,"Or, if it helps, I can take the $2,250 as a deposit and hold for you for a month so you can come up with the rest of the money."
That's too steep for me at this time. I still would have to make sure it is roadworthy. That's really nice of you but I will need that month to get it ready for her to take to college.,"Ok, let me know if you change your mind.   I would love to help you out, but I can't go for half of what I'm asking."
Hi I am interesting in buying your Casella Lighting. Would you be willing to lower the price a small amount?,The price is pretty much firm but we could possibly trade.  I'm looking for a Honda Generator.  You have one?
Unfortunately I do not. How about if I agree to pick up the lights in my truck you agree to lower the price to $900. I could be there today cash in hand.,I only have one and am asking $675.  If you want to pay me $900 I'll take it!
I apologize I mis typed that I meant to offer $600.,haha  I kind of thought so.  Do you have anything else you could trade?
"No, I'm not looking to trade anything just interested in purchasing the lights.",If you pick it up today and pay cash I'll accept $625.  Fair?
"Yes, that's fair. Thank you.",Great!  We have a deal then.

"Yes, how many miles are on this vehicle?","100,000"
Has the vehicle been in any accidents? Any flood damage?,no accidents. clean title. very good shape.
Great. I would like to make an offer. Would you accept $2500 for the vehicle. I have cash and could pay and pick up vehicle today,I will do 3700 but cant go lower than that
I could do $3500 and cover any transfer costs.,okay that sounds good. you are picking up tonight?
Hi,"Hello, I am almost giving this away at only 3000. Its very nice."
Could you fit a radio on this in the front?,You sure could. And I will throw in a raido all for 3000
"That sounds great, how does it ride on cracks and such?",It ride like its floating on air. Just like a brand new Caddy.
"Ok I like that, I do not have $300 in my pocket... can you do $2,500?",I will diliver it to you for 2750
"sounds great, deal",deal and enjoy !
I am great! Hope you are well. I saw your listing and I am very interested in  this item.  How long have you had the item?,Doing great.  Thanks.  Haven't had it long at all.  Purchased and really don't use at all..  Just looking to sell.

Great! I will take it!,Great.  Thanks!

Is it more for a male or female?,honestly it really could go either way
Would you be willing to deliver it to me? It won't fit into my car.,yes I sure can
If I pay in cash would you accept $140 for the bike?,I can do $165 since I will be delivering
Yes. It is completely furnished?,"Yes it is, how many people would be living here"
Just one.  $3500 is a little out of my budget.  I'd be wililing to sign a longer lease if you could come down to  $2400,"Ok and this is a great home for one person, and what about $2600?"
I could do $2600,Ok good
"Excited to hear more about this home. How many bedrooms, bathrooms, and what is the neighborhood like?",The neighborhood is very safe! Was even featured on mostsafeneighborhoods.com. It has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Everythings been recently remodeled.

I am interested in the leather couch you have.  Are there any worn spots or tears?,"No, it's in great condition - almost as good as when I first bought it"
"OK.  It says minor wear, so would you take $40?",I think $40 might be a little low. Is $45 okay?
Hello. I came across your listing for an apartment. It looks very nice. I would like to know if you allow any pets at all?,PETS ARE ALLOWED.FEEL FREE TO YOUR HOME
"That is wonderful. Thank you. This apartment would stretch the budget a bit, but having pets is a great perk. Is there any parking available?",yes
My original budget was $850 but saving money on parking will help. Would you consider $1250?,can u offer 1800$
the bike looks nice has it ever been wrecked,Nope! I got it for exercise a couple years ago.

"Hi, there. I'm interested in the car you're selling.",Are there any question you may have?
Hi. I'm interested in your truck. Is it still available?,Yes it is
It mentions the starter might be iffy on it. Is that sytill acting up?,Here and there but not too often
"How hard are you on that 22,500 price tag? That's a little steep for me.",I can come down a little bit but the truck is awesome with many custom features
I'm looking at 18000 as my best offer. Interested in taking that?,"Sorry, that's a little low for this great truck"
hi how are you doing? can you tell me what kind of phone is this?,A silver samsung galaxy edge 7
are there any cracks or other flaws I should be aware of?,"Perfect condition! 32 gig memory, only works with Sprint"
When was this phone bought?,Very recently! And it has not been used too much!
I would love to buy it then. Would you negotiate a little from your price? Would 250 be okay?,I'll accept 250 if you are willing to meet in person and pick it up in the next two days!
I will meet up with you tomorrow and pick it up! 250 sounds great. Thanks so much!,Perfect!
Hello. Is the phone still available?,Yes absolutely!
How long have you owned it?,Only about one year
How much did you use it?,"I used it for about one year, but I always used it with a cover so the condition is excellent!"
Would you be willing to do $300 with the cover included?,Yes sure I can do that
"Yes, I am.  Can you tell me a bit more about it?","Yeah, we've used the couch for only a few years, my wife wants to upgrade as we move out of town, it's pretty peerless, not many stains."
"Is it pretty well-built, substantial?","Definitely, the cushions haven't really changed since we bought it, which is nice. It's like beige."
I'm a little bothered by the light color. What kind of fabric is it?,"It might be corduroy or upholstered fabric, I can't remember that well. Well if you don't like the fabric that much, I could throw in the pillows too, if you want."
I'd like that - I like to be comfortable when I watch TV and this looks like a good set for it.  So what would you take for it?,"525 for the set with the pillows, I'll bring it down a little, as you seem genuinely interested despite any setbacks."
Hmmm...how about delivery?  I can see that price if you can bring it to me - I'm just across town but don't have a truck and would have to borrow one.,"Oh yeah we have a truck, I'll handle that for you. How does later in the week sound?"
Friday after work?,I can do that.
hi is the bike in good shape? Do the gears work well?,"Yes the gears are great. It's a wonderful bike, but I'll admit it could use a little TLC. I have a newer bike that I've been riding and neglected this guy."
Is the seat in good shape? What does it need as far as TLC?,The seat is good and the wellgo pedals have straps.
"Nice, I was wondering if you would be able to take $75 cash today if I came and picked it up now?",I was really hoping to get a little more out of it since it was my dad's bike. I'll replace the chain for you if you can come up to $100
"I appreciate sentiment, ok I'll go with the $100 but could I come in the morning instead?",SOunds great. See you then.
Hello can you tell me how old this bike is?,"It's only about 3 months old, it is my wife's but its a little too large for her."
Is everything in working order?,"Yes it works great, almost new. Only has 50 miles on it."
That's great. I just have a tight budget this month and need a new bike to get to work. Can you go any lower on the price?,I can negotiate a little. What did you have in mind?
I was hoping for 900$ that leaves me a little breathing room in the budget. Just need a good sturdy bike to get to work.,I could do $950 and I'll even throw in an automatic tire pump and deliver it.
"HI, how are you","I am not too bad, I have a beautiful 1 bedroom apartment available, its one of a kind with a spectacular patio view"
"That sounds great. I am familiar with the listing, I am willing to pay you $800 for the rental","I am sorry, but that offer is far lower than I can accept. this is a prime location so the best I can do is $1,500"
"Based on the size of the apartment, I think that rice is very unreasonable. I recently saw a similar apartment for $900. The max I can pay for this aparment in $1000","The amenities in this apartment are top notch, it was recently remodeled and has been well taken care of. Tell you what, I can do $1350, and I will throw in free monthly parking which is usually $50 a month"
"If you can do it for 1250, we have a deal","I can do that, we have a deal"
"Hi, I'm interested in your sofa and loveseat.  Is it real leather?","Hi! The pictures don't do this sofa and loveseat justice! The items are genuine Italian black leather and come from a smoke and pet free home. I bought them last year, so they are in very good condition. I'm only selling because I'm moving and looking for different furniture. how much are you looking to spend?"
I would like to spend about $150 but will pay extra for delivery.,$150 is far too low for these items.They are in great condition and you are getting a sofa and love seat! Most people can't even purchase a chair for that price. What about $300 and I'l include delivery?
"Ouch, that's only $20 off the original price.  I can go as high as $200 and that's with delivery.","Since I want 320 and you want 150, let's meet directly in the middle at 235. I can deliver at 250 or you can pick up at 235. This price gives us both what we want and is the most fair option. You're getting a really good deal at that price!"
"Hi, I am interested in purchasing your speaker system.","Hi, thanks for checking it out. It's in great condition. What are you willing to offer for it?"
Does this include the cables to hook it to the TV?  I can offer you $75 and pick it up today.,"Yes. Everything that is needed, excluding additions that I purchased while I had it, come along with it. I am looking for just a little bit more for it though. How does $95 sound?"
Can we do 80? I really have to stay within a budget.,We should be able to do $80. So if we have a deal I'll have it ready for you to come by later today.
Deal.,Awesome!
I'm interested in your tv. Is it brand new inside box?,"yes - inside the box, never opened it!"

"hello, nice bicycle!",Thank you! Its a great bike. 1980 vintage Masi
I am sorry but why you sell it so much? I can see it's a good piece but I think the price is too much! Any dents or other issues?,"Well to start this is an original Nuova Strada, imported from Italy in the mid 1980. Its vintage. Many confuse it with California Masi but it isnt"
"Hmm, I was hoping for a better offer,around 750$. I will pay you cash of course!",$750 is too low. How about $900. I think thats a great deal for this relic
I will come and pick it up myself tomorrow if you accept $870,Yeah that works. $870 is a deal
Hey!,How can I help you?
"I was looking for a BMX bike and was hoping to find a good deal, can you help me out?",Sure. I'm selling this bike for $10
Oh interesting is that your bottom dollar?,"Yes, I'm basically selling this for pennies."
Yea I understand but just for fun would you be willing to drop the price closer to 5 if I run by the bank and grab you some coins?,"Unless they're gold coins, I'm not interested. I'll take something else of equal value, though."
"Hmmm, I don't have any gold coins....",Then it's $10 or something of equal value.
Okay I want the bike so I will pay your price of $10.00!,Okay.
"Hi, I'm interested in the apartment.",Excellent. It is in great condition and I am asking 1861 for it.

That works for me!,Would you like to stop by today and check them out?
"That sounds great, we can be there around 4.",Sounds good. See you then.
Hi. I am interested in the phone. Can you accept 49?,That's a little lower than I'd like to sell it for. It's a great phone and in perfect condition. I'm only selling it because I bought a 32gb model (I have a TON of music and needed more storage).
Does it come with the charge cord and the headphones?,It does come with the charger but I don't have any headphones for it. How about I lower the price to $85 so you can buy a pair with the savings?
If I can meet you in one hour I'll give you 75 cash.,"I can meet in an hour, but only for $80, deal?"
Hi,Hi. I see your interested in my home for rent?

"I think my nanny is smuggling cocaine, this item could help me",It definitely will hep! It is top of the line.

I'm on a really tight budget right now. Do you think you could do $2000 if I signed for the 13 months and paid a first and last deposit?,"2500 if the lowest I can go, man. I can't give it away."
"I can squeeze out maybe $2250, if I eat ramen noodles for while!",lol sounds like a deal!
"HI! I am really interested in hyour trunk, it is beautiful. Is it an antique?","The one in the picture? It's actually a chest - it was my parents, it's pretty old but not sure if it qualifies as an antique yet!@"

Hello.,Good evening.  I have an amazing townhome for rent.  Were you able to see the picture and read all the amenities?
"Yes, I could see and read everything. I'm very interested in your townhome but it's a little too much money for me. My ideal price range is around $1100.","The other townhomes in our complex go for $2500, so $2200 is a great deal.  I would be willing to go down to $1800 if you sign a 9-month or year-long lease."
I would be willing to sign a year-long lease for $1800 as long as the deposit and down payments are not too expensive. If they total up to $2200 I would not be able to.,"I can waive the application fee for you.  We normally require first and last month rent.  If that doesn't work for you, why don't we do $1900 a month?"

That doesn't fit into my budget at all.,875 then? I can't go down to 760.
Yeah that sounds like a fair deal.,Thank you

"Yes, I am.  I'd like to make an offer of $75 and I will pick up the item.",$75 is too low. I just bought this item and haven't even used it.

Yes I am. I just want to make sure it works all right,"It is perfect and has less then 15,000 miles on it.  It's a great car with great gas mileage too."
How is the interior?,It is in great condition too and the radio and CD player are great.
All sounds great. But I only have 7000 cash on me for it,"I can't go that low, but I could do 9000. if you had something to trade in."
I have a few food gift cards I could give you.,Let's do it.  I think you need the car.
"I just saw your ad, I'd be willing to offer $65","Hi, please make me an offer."
$65,How about 67?
I'll do $67,we have a deal
"Hello, I'm interested in this 2005 Caddy. What kind of shape is the engine in?",In terms of appearance the engine has been detailed so everything is clean.
"Welp, considering that this a 2005 with 120k miles on it, has small dents and the rivets on the hood because of a previous rack, I'm prepared to offer $2160.",Well what if I threw in some rim locks tor prevent anti rim theft and also a slightly used sun shade for the dash would that be able to get you up to 2500
"Nah, I don't need any of that but thanks anyway. Do you know what the blue book price is for this car in this condition?",I dont remember exactly but in perfect condition I believe it was 1500 more than my list price.
How about we meet somewhere in the middle. I'll offer $2300,at that price Id only be able to trow in the sunshade for the dash.
I don't need the sunshade :),then Id certainly be willing to go for that. However I could deliver it to you for 200 more?
"Hey so I'm really interested in the room, but I'm a little reluctant of the price.","Okay, that's understandable. The good news is that you get $1000 off the first month rent!"
"Yes yes, and you pay my deposit. However, the studio in the area you're in is only worth $800 a month. That means I'm losing $1200 a month for 12 months is $14,400 a year. Sure I get $1000 back but it's not worth it.",Don't think of it as losing. Think of it as a benefit for that first month. What price are you looking for for an apartment?
"I'm looking to pay $800 a month, I'll pay you the deposit and we'll skip the rebate.",How about $1400 a month?
"I can come down to $1200 but that's it, and a 6 month lease not 12.","Okay, that works."
"Hi, that is a really nice bike, I have been looking for one like that. How does it ride? Does it have any damage?","This is in great condition. It rides very nice. There is no damage. It is a bit dirty, but that's it."
How long have you used it for?,I bought this six months ago.
Would you take 200 for it. I have cash and I can pick it up today.,If you come today with the 200 it is yours!
how's the speaker? not blown or anything?,"We've rocked out hard on ones like this, but this was a spare we kept in a storage unit. Rock on brother?"
well that suggest the speaker is worn out. tell you what. i'll give you 41 for it and i'll come and pick it up myself.,Sounds good.
"Hello, yes, I'm interested in the product in your listing?","Hello, any questions i can answer for you?"
"Well, is there anything wrong with the ipad?","No it works great, I just upgraded so its time for a new one"
"Well, I might be interested, what version of iOS is installed on the ipad?","The last update was 10.0, I just did the update on it. Its a great ipad."
"Hmm. Well, I'd like to pay $175.",Thats a little lower than i was hoping id get. Can you come up to 350? Apple products are great and they hold theyre value very well.
"I can buy a 2017 ipad for $400. I'd be willing to come up to $200, and I'll come pick it up, but I couldn't go any higher than that.",ok i can do 200. When will you pick up?
"Well, how about I come by tonight to grab it?",sounds great! Ill have it ready to go!
Hello! I got a phone that I need unlocked. Do you unlock any carrier?,Yes I can and for only $50 dollars. Very much worth the price. I've seen some people pay $500 for a phone they can't use and have to sell it for around $100 because parts aren't worth as much.
"Wow! nice, I'm in a bit of a bind and would only be able to afford $40 right now, is that something you'd be able to work with?",How about $45. I understand your predicament but these things do take up so much of my time. This is my only source of income right now.
How old is this chair?,Less than a year old.
Okay...and has this been used in an office? Or at a home?,It was in a college dorm for a month
Is there anything wrong with this at all?,"Well, there are some problems. It's missing a drawer divider and it's scratched. For some reason I can't really fathom, I decided to color in the scratches with a brown marker, even though I'm a master finish carpenter. I guess I was just incredibly lazy when I was getting ready to sell this furniture."
Then with all that said would you take $50 for it?,"50 seems way too low, lets have a little more negotiation here. Let me tell you, this is a very sturdy piece of furniture, it can easily take the weight of two adults slamming into it for at least 20 minutes. That's how it got the scratches."
Oh wow okay. Well with all your telling me this doesn't seem worth much more than 50 to me.,"Friend, this is the perfect side table for so many things, the drawers are big enough to hold all sorts of adult toys. It would be a steal at $80."
Hmm how about 70 if i come get it today?,"Okay, you come to pick it up, you can have it for $75, and I'll even throw in whatever's left in the drawers when you get here. Don't worry, it's all been sterilized."
I like the dresser in I am interested in buying how long have you had the dresser?,I have had it a few years. I hate to get rid of but I am moving
I would like to offer you $454 which includes me picking it up and getting it off your hands. $464 cash on hand,That is much lower then I was hoping for. It is a great piece. Once you refinish it the value will go up so much more.
Would you accept $575,How about 600?
"hello, is your lamp still for sale?",Hi. Yes it is.
great! im interested in buying it but was wondering how old it is.,I bought it at a flea market about a year ago so I am not sure.
"okay, and does it come with lightbulbs already in or do i need to buy my own?",No it comes with lightbulbs.
"okay, well i was wondering if i could pick it up today for $60 instead of $65? i need to make sure i keep money for tolls and other expenses but really am interested in the lamp.",I bought it at a flea market about a year ago so I am not sure.
"yes, i can pick them up today. thank you.",No it comes with lightbulbs.
"hello, i am interested in an apartment","great, its move in ready and listed at 2172 a month"
thats more than I can do right now how about1500?,"sorry that is too low, lowest I could do is 2000 and waive half of the deposit"
I really like this apartment could you do 1800 and I do some work for you? I'm pretty handy,sorry no
"Hello, I am interested in your iPad. Is it still available?",Yes it is! It is in amazing condition!
Great! I am wondering if the price is negotiable?,"A little, but it is in fantastic shape and comes with a case."
"I already have a case, so I don't need or want the case.","Okay, then I would drop the price to $165."
I am really wanting to pay around $125,I can't go that low. I would go down to $150
"I am willing to pick it up today and pay cash. I have $135, that is all. Would you be willing to take that?",I suppose that would work if you pick it up soon with cash.
"Hello, I am interested in purchasing your Honda CRV EX",Oh great! What would you like to know?
Are you willing to negotiate on the price?,"I sure am, but it is a great car!"
"Yeah, I was actually thinking about purchasing the 2017 but the 2015 is great too. Would you be willing to sell it for $14000?","The listen price is 22,000. What if we split the difference and go to 18,000"
That's still a little steep. What about $15000?,"Hmm, thats not really enough. Its basically a new car. I can go to 17,500"
How about $16500?,Can you come pick it up?
I sure can,Great! Deal!
"Doing well, and you?",Very well! Are you interested in my listing? Any questions?
Yeah - how long is your commute?  Is it daily?  I want to know how many miles you're going to add before I can get it picked up.,It is my daily commuting car so the mileage WILL go up but my commute is less than 5 miles so it's a non-issue.
"Okay, that's good.  I'm going to level with you, though - I don't think your initial offer is fair if the registration expires in five days.",OK what are you willing to offer?
"Given taxes and fees for the tag exchange and registration renewal, I'd say knock $500 off?",Sure $3000 is fair!
hello men i like this,so you are interested in the nest products?
"yes, i can give you 165.00","well that is reasonable , but let me ask you are into a better deal for multiple units? I ask  because I have four"
okay what about 175.00,just for th eone?
just the one,can you come and pick it up today?
okay i will fly to you to day and pick it up,alright sounds like a deal
"Hi, how are the tires?",If you zoom in on the photo you can see they are practically new...only ridden it few times since I got them

Yes is there a frame included?,"It's unframed, but the canvas itself is mounted on wood."
Okay good to know that. So lets get to the price. How much are you selling it for?,"I'm asking $125, which includes delivery costs."
That's too pricey for me. Can we lower it down a bit please? It doesn't come in my budget,"Well, I could see maybe going to $110, but it's a rare piece, so I think that would still be a fair price."
I could do $115. That's very kind of you. Thank you so much! So do you take cash or credit?,Either works fine. Thanks for your offer.
Hi! I see you are interested in buying my Toyota Solara. Do you have any particular questions?,Yes. How much would you like for it?

That will work!,Thank you very much. Good doing business with you.
Hi! I'm interested in buying your truck.,"Ok, what can I do to help complete this deal?"
"Well, I can't afford $6000. I was hoping to negotiate with you a bit. Would you be willing to accept $3000?",That`s a little low. How about $4500 and I will drop it off?
Dropping it off it helpful. Any other perks you might be willing to throw in to sweeten the deal?,"I can cut it down to $4000,"
"Hello, do you accept pets?",It depends on the pet.  What kind of animal is it?
It is a small dog.,How old is your dog?  And is it housebroken?  We have carpet in most of the home
Yes she's housetrained. She's around 4-5 and fine with carpets. It wouldn't be an issue.,It shouldn't be a problem then.  There will be a small pet deposit but if there is no damage you will get that back on leaving.

BTW - Hookups just mean there are places to hook up your washer and dryer as they aren't included! Glad we could come to an agreement

every where else I have searched has been much higher with less features. I love the deal you are offering. I know my grandparents will love this. I will accept $1500.,"great I will see you and your grandparents later this week, at your convenience to sign a lease! see you soon!"
Hey I'm interested in your bike. How firm is that price?,"Well, it's old, so I can negotiate."
I was thinking something like 140 is in my price range.,I might go down to $180 if you can come get it today.
If we can settle up at 165 I'll come right now with cash.,If you have $170 it's a deal.
Yes,great. do you have any questions?
How heavy is the item?,The item is probably only about 30 pounds not nearly as heavy as it looks
Can it be delievered or will I have to pick up?,You will have to pick it up. I do not have a truck to haul it in
I see. Are you willing to lower price if I come and get it now?,possibly. what price were you thinking?
I was thinking 35$.,I dont think I can go that low. but how about 55?
How about 50$,50 if you can be here in one hour and it's a deal buddy.
Is this bike in good condition?,"yes, just refurbished"
Do you think it would be comfortable for a shorter person?,"yes, seat is adjustable , medium frame"
1300 is a bit high. Would you come down to 1150?,how about 1200 and we call it a deal?
Deal!,thanks
Would you take $42?,I think it's worth more. What about $60?
$60 is a little bit too high for my budget. It is used afterall...,How about $50?
"$50 is fair, I'll take it!",Ok
Hello,hello
"I saw your listing for the flip phone, and was interested in buying it from you. How much has it been used so far?",It has been previously used for only 3 weeks
"That is a reasonable amount of time, do you happen to have a headset or any devices for hands free capabilities to pair with it?","It's like new, the use on the phone was minimal. The phone is equipped with push to talk (hands free) and accessories with the manual for the phone"
"That sounds good, I'm willing to pay $30 for it, accessories included. Does this sound reasonable for you?",Accessories are included. Could you do $35? It's listed for $39 currently.
"I didn't want to pay too much for a new phone, so I was hoping $30 would be good for you. Would an extra $2 be alright with you?","Sure, $32 is good with me."
Hello,Hi
So I saw your ad for the comfy couches. I am interested and am offering a price of $350.,These are great couches.  I'm very sorry to have to part with them.  Let's split the difference at $375.
Is there anything wrong with them? Are they sagging anywhere? Any bad smells or stains?,"nothing wrong with them at all.  no stains, no sags, no smells. they're in great shape."
How about $368?,$370
"Hello, I am interested in purchasing this home. I noticed you had it listed at about $3550, and I was curious how much you would come down from that?","Yes, I'm trying to sell it pretty fast. I'm in negotiations with two other buyers right now so I can do around $3400."
"Okay, that's a little higher than I would like to go. If I were willing to pay $3400 for this property, would you be willing to cover the closing costs associated with buying it?",I can do 3350$ and cover the closing costs.
Hello. Are you still selling the bike?,"I've had a few offers, but I'm willing to see what you have to say"
How old is the bike and what kind of condition is it in?,"It's a vintage, so it has a great personality!  Haha it's actually in great condition, I was never really able to use it much"
Okay and it has also been repainted right?,"Yes, I got it professionally done"
That's good but with the original paint it would be worth more. Would you sell it for 140?,"That's pretty low.  Even sanded down, this bike is worth 190.  Lowest I can go is 200 with what I put into it already (mods and painting)"
"Modifying it actually decreases the value too, customizing something makes it worth less you don't just add on the cost of custom parts. That takes away any value it had as a vintage item.","Hmm, well it sounds like you probably aren't interested then.  As a non-vintage bike, it's worth 200.  The vintage should add on to it.  Lowest I'll go is 180 if you pick it up."
Does this come with the charger?,"These bands are great. They help with tracking steps, so you can lose weight"
Are you calling me fat? I should get a better deal than because I really need to lose weight.,I'll throw in some McDonalds gift cards if you pay full price
Hello. I am interested in your mirror,It is a great mirror. I used it on the mantel to reflect Christmas lights during the holidays.
sounds really nice. Does it have any scratches? is it in good condition?,No scratches and in great condition.
ok I would be willing to pay $35 for it and I will come over and pick it up later this evening,That is perfect.  I know you will enjoy it.
so we have a deal at 35? I will be over later,Yes we have a deal
Hi there how are you?,good
Hi. Lovely bed.  How long have you had the bed frame?,I have had the whole piece for less than a year and am willing to make a fair deal if interested?
I'm definitely interested in the whole bed.  Any nicks on the frame?,"No heavy wear it is over all in great condition, I would consider it to be like new."
Okay. That sounds pretty good. Any stains on the mattress?,No it had a mattress pad in smoke free home
All great sounding. What finish is the wood? I just want to make sure it matches the rest of my furniture? Mahogany?,"Actually, the lighting in the picture makes the color a bit off it is a dark reddish brown."
Okay that'll work. How about 150?,"Could you meet me maybe somewhere in the middle, I have kept it in excellent condition."
Okay.  I can do 210.,"210 is a fair price, and I can do that. You are able to pick it up?"
"Hi I am on a budget but am interested in your tv, would you be willing to accept 875 for it?","I think my starting offer is really low, but I will accept 950 and the delivery cost is on me!"
i want to restore this bike so ill be upfront and ask for a deep discount,I'm open to negotiations.What price are you willing to pay?
restoration will cost about 600  so how about we reach halfway at 500,"The bike itself is in great shape,besides the scuffs and sticker scratches. Would you be willing to come up more? I feel that 500 is too low for this bike."
"sounds fair , i can do 675",Can we meet up at 700
deal,deal!
"Yeah, $3000",Way too low!
3500?,The Kelley Blue Book value is 4700. I am looking to sell on my own because it benefits me and the buyer
The most I can pay is $4200,"If you can take it off my hands tonight, I'll give it to you for 4300"
Nice table. How much are you selling it for?,"Oh yes, it's a great vintage table, thanks! I'm asking $30 for it."
I'll take it off your hands for 20. I'll come myself take it today. I am ready to roll for today for 20,That sounds great! Thanks so much!
"Hi, I see that you are selling a bike, I dont have much money but im willing to pay $25 since its a used item",Wow that is too small. Bought the bike new about 2 years ago and my kid rode it not up to 10 times. Its still like new. No wear or scratches.It just need to be cleaned up. Step up your price a bit
"Ok, I can do better I can offer $50 and even though it was used one time it has 2 years I might have to give it maintanece",It does not need any maintenance at least now because we do that regulary. The wheels work well. the break system perfect. The paint also still like new. Everything functions perfectly. I can step down to $80 for you
I cant do that! the most I can pay is $65 but I cant afford to pay more than that. That would be my final offer I understand if you cant step it down to tha price.,I can consider $70 since you will be coming to pick it up yourself. $70 is the least i can offer it. Deal?
"Hello, I am very interested in this listing","I'm glad to hear it! The studio is super nice. All of our units just got renovated so it's all modern appliances and pretty much everything else you could ask for.

what is the price for the studio,Asking price is 1625.
would you be willing to take 1450?,"I could go as low as 1500, but It would have to be on an 18 month lease as opposed to the typical 12. Would that be alright for you?"
Hi there,howdy
does this come from a smoke free home?,Yes it does.
Does it have any scratches?,It has a couple of tiny dings but only when you look at it very closely
Hmm. what type fo wood is this unit?,"I'm not sure exactly, I believe it is pine."
"Okay, Would you take$18 for it?",I think 20 is a fair price considering I originally paid 99$ for it.
what if I come pick it up? It is also now used with some marks on it.,Ok then I will take 18 if 2$ is that big of a deal to you.
hi. are they all new?,"They are not new, but they work like new"
"I see. tell you what, I'll give 15 for them. I'll even come and pick it up from your place.",oh that works for me
Hello,Are you interested in my phone?
I'd like to offer you $94 for it.,"The phone is in great condition, and I feel that it is worth more than that."
"Okay, what do you feel it's worth then?","Since it has no scratches, and is still in fantastic condition, I think it is worth more like $130."
It's two models old though. I can offer you $110 but that's as high as I'll go.,That's fair.
Hi are the headphones still avaible?,Yes they are!
Can you tell me how good they worked when you previsouly used them flying? I travel a lot for work and would love to buy them,"Sure! I've only ever used them twice, but they worked really well.

$125 and you have a deal.,"Excellent, sold for $125"
"Hi. I'm interested in the phone, but I'm not so sure about the asking price.","Ok, is there anything about it you want to know?? Its in great shape and I feel the price is set pretty well but tell me what you think"
I would be willing to pay $96 for the phone.,"$110 and we have a deal, and I'll throw in an extra charger"
"For that price, I would have to require a set of earphones as a part of the deal.","Ok, I have an extra set. Deal"
"Just to be clear, $110 for the phone, earphones, and a charger. Right?",yes.
Hi I'm very interested in this. I see it has high speed internet is that included in the price?,"Yes, it is included.  among other perks like our 24 hour gym."
Can I bring my dog with me?,Pets are welcome!
Awesome! Could the price be lowered a bit?,yes a little
Like 1700?,I think if you could do 1750.. we could make a deal.
Hey I'm interested in your TV. How firm is the price? It seems a bit steep for a used plasma TV.,Actually I am rather firm this tv is selling used for over 1200 all over the place.  Mine is lower by a bit because i need it to go quick.  Why how much were you thinking?
"I was looking to spend more around 497 dollars. I can find plasmas all day at the same size for a similar price. I would be willing to use cash, come pick it up, and toss in a mint condition iphone at that price.",what model Iphone?
It's an unlocked 7. It's worth over 600 right now. I have no use for it an I'm in the market for a TV.,"I have really wanted one of those, as long as it is not locked you have a deal."

"Yes, I seen that. Can you tell me a little more about the phone? any dings or scratches? Does it come with a case?","There's some very minor scratches on the back, but otherwise it's pristine. It also comes with Apple's warranty if you happen to have any issues down the line. No case included, I'm afraid."
"Sounds like a great deal, unfortunately I'm on a tight budget. Will you happen to take $416 for the phone?","I'm sorry, I'm not taking less than $500 for this."
"Hmm, how about $480 if I come out now and pay in cash? I know you said no less then $500 but I really love that phone!",I can live with that. $480 it is.

Are they tires only or is it an extra set of wheels with tires?,Tires onl;y
Hm.  Okay.  Well the bike is really nice and the tires will be helpful.  If I drive to you to pick it up with cash in hand would you do 650?,that's too low. I can give it to you $900 nothing less than that
If you can drive to me I can do 800 but unless you have anything else to offer with it I simply cannot afford to pay your asking price of 900.,Well I have already given you the tires. I can't do more than that. Take it or leave it then. I am sorry I can't go lower than that.

I've heard that Samsungs have issues. I've heard the Toshiba's are the best TV's.,I would have to disagree as I have not heard the same thing

"The ad says it's a 2016. That means it is a year old. So it is NOT brand new. $1,500","true not BRAND new, but it has not been used and is in perfect condition. I would be willing to sell it for 1800. That is a good deal because it comes with several accessories and a warranty"
How long is the warranty for?,until January 2018

"Oh ok...I understand that I am going to submit my offer directly...if you could work with me since we do have to transport it ourselves, in the final price I am going to offer for it, I would appreciate it.",Please let me know on the texting what you want to offer because you can only make one offer.

The price is a little too high for my budget and it seems a bit higher than other apartments in that area. But, I really like the location. Are you willing to negotiate the rent a little?",yes we can negotiate. If you move all your stuff in here on your own terms then we can arrange for the price to be set at $2000 instead.
this home is absolutely perfect.,It is a marvelous and spacious home! Are you interested?
I am very interested. Are you interested in lowering the monthly price a bit if I were to sign a 24 month lease?,"Yes, I could do $4000 for a two year lease."
Hello what's the mileage on your truck?,80k mostly highway miles.
what's the miles per gallon like on highway?,Around 18-24.
"okay, that's not bad for a truck. You're asking 11500?","Yes, which I think is more than fair considering the mileage and condition."
The mileage is great. The price seems high because of how old it is but I guess you just didn't drive it a lot. Are you the original owner?,"Yes, no accidents. Toyotas hold their values and run forever."
"They do, I had a camry, but it was notorious for not starting if it sat too long without being cranked. Did you keep this truck in a garage while you weren't using it?",The truck was garage kept. I am willing to sell it for 11k cash.
"That still seems like a lot for a vehicle that's over a decade old. I'll have to do a tune up on it, new spark plugs, hoses, etc.",10.5k is the lowest I'll go. I just listed and others have expressed interest.
750,that's way to low
875,$2000 is set
1700,OK I accept this price
Hey! I just saw your post for the apartment!,Hi.  Great!  What do you think of it/
"I think it's a decent deal, but I have a few questions.","Sure, go ahead."
"Im curious if there is much to do in the area. Is there many stores, and restaurants that are near by?","So, a short distance away is downtown Hayward which has shopping places and restaurants"
Hi! The house you have for rent looks amazing! Hows the neighborhood?,"The neighbors are really nice, there is low amount of crime and the price is only 3300!"
"Looks amazing! I would need a 6 month lease, since Im active military. Could we do that?","Yes I can work that out for you, should I send you the offer then?"
"If i paid the whole 6 months plus the deposit, could we work out a discount price? I like to be money savy haha",Hmm that's a good idea and yes how about I can go down to 2500 if you can pay all that upfront is that an okay discount?
"$2500 sounds great, can we meet tomorrow to view the house and go over paperwork?","Yes I will send you the offer for 2500 and we can work out the details when we meet, thank you!"
Deal!,deal
"Can we negotiate a lower price, say 40?",Well why do you want the chairs?
Hi. I'm interested in buying your end tables.,Great.  You'll love the table it is very high quality.
Oh? Is there something special about the item that makes it stand out?,"Yes, they are made of high quality oak."
That sounds fantastic. What condition are they in? Any scuffs or marks on them?,They are in good condition.  I could sell one to you for $150.00
Any wiggle room there? They really do look fantastic but I'm on a budget. I could pick them up myself for a discount.,I could come down a little if you picked them up. What would you be willing to offer?
"I could offer you 100 dollars cash, tonight.","That might be a little lower than I can take for the table.  If you were able to pick it up and give me $140 cash, I'd do it."
That's a bit too high for me sadly. But because they are such high quality I would be willing to stretch myself. How about we meet in the middle? 125 and I take it off your hands tonight? What do you say? Really can't afford any higher.,"You get what you pay for.  I promise you will love this table.  I can come down from my original price, but I still have to get a fair price for the table.  If you can do 129, I'll do the deal."
"I understand that, but since I'm offering a fast easy deal, cash, an picking it up myself I do think that 125 is fair. It saves you the gas. Plus that is honestly all I have on me. I love the item but I can't go borrowing money to buy it.",I really want to do the deal with you.  How about $125 cash and you mow my lawn tonight.  That way you don't have to borrow money and I'll get a fair price for the table.
Hello do you still have the iphone for sale?,Hi there! I sure do.
What's the least you can take since it's an older model,Hi there! I sure do.
Well the 7's are out now and I think 150 would be a great price for it,"It's not that old, and it's pretty much brand new. I bought it for my grandparents and they got frustrated and couldn't figure out how to use it. It is unlocked though, so you don't have to be with a certain carrier to use it. I would like to get $340 out of it."
Well what if I pick it up myself could you go 250?,"As long as you meet me somewhere on this side of town, yes."

How badly is the screen cracked?,"small crack on lower right side. It was in a case when it took the fall, which just baffled me. Im due for an upgrade so ill be getting that done in next day or two."
Due to it being cracked would you be willing to accept $55?,"How bout I deliver it to you for $60, and ill toss in the case and a belt clip?"
I am interested in the Curio cabinet.  How many shelves does it have and does the light work?,It has three shelves.
Are they adjustable or set in place? I have the perfect place for this!,One is set in place. Right along the wooden brace there under the knobs. The other two are adjustable.
Awesome!  Is the wood in good condition.  THe picture looks like it is all clear without any blemishes?  Where I would like to put it you would be able to see each side.,"Yes, the wood is in good condition. It is old but the wood is in good condition."
"Okay, I would like to offer you $60 cash and I can pick it up within the hour.","Since you can get it within the hour, I'll take the 60. Deal."
Hello. I just saw your posting. Can you tell me is this all in working order?,"Hello, yes everything works fine. Its brand new never used."

Has it been in any accidents? Any scratches or dents?,"I've been away at school, no one has really used it except for my grandmother to go to church. All the info is in the Car Fax."
Could you take $4200 for it?,"$2400 is too low. Its electric, you aren't going to pay for gas ever. I could come down to probably $7500 if you come pick it up."
How about $6800?,$7300 and I'll let you keep the jumper cables and seat covers.
Hello,HI What service are you needing for your phone?
I need what you are selling. It is a service right and not a tangible object?,Right we can unlock or flash your phone so that you can use your phone on another network as most carriers lock their phones so you are stuck with them.
That sounds pretty good. Are you willing to negotiate on the price a bit?,Well what cell phone carrier are you with now
I am with Cricket,"well we actually have a special for their phones right now, we flash your phone so you can use it with metropcs and include your first month of service, a $30 value all for $50"

Hello,Hello!
Are you interested in this tv stand I've got for sale today?,"Well, I am the one with the TV Stand for sell. I am wanting to sell it."

Will you take $60 for it?,"That is too low, I could come down to $75."
"Hey there, nice car, is it new",Its not new but its in very good condition and has had maintenance done so its all working fine and checked up. Im looking for around 10k
"My budget's around 9k, but can you help me remove the strips? I need it for work","I can't help you with that, unless you want to pay 10k and Ill have it done before I sell you it. However Im fine with 9k as a final price If you can worry about the strip yourself"
What year is it from? I'll give you 9.2 if you help me with the physical labor to take off the strips?,"Its 2011. I don't really want to worry about the strips im sorry dude. there are people that would pay my original asking price of 10.2k and be happy with the strips. I can do 9k for you, but you're on your own to deal with the strips."
"hi, I am very interestedin this unit. But, I do have a few questions.",Certainly! Ask away.
"Is it a relatively safe area? I have a 4 year old and dont want to put her in any danger.

How are the tires on this?,The tires are great.  My wife only used this bike for 3 months before she switched to a hybrid.  The whole bike is in fabulous condition.
Oh wow. So there are no problems with it at all?,None.  I am only selling it because we have enough bikes around our place and need some space.
That makes sense well I have $50 cash on me and a giftcard for $10 to the mall I'd like to offer you,"I'm not a mall guy at all, and $50 is pretty cheap for such an amazing ride.  I'm willing to go $75.  How does that sound to you?"
If you can throw in a helmet you've got a deal.,"I can do that!  You know women--my wife bought a brand new helmet to go with her new bike, so we have a practically new one we can throw in no problem.  You've got yourself a deal."
"Hello, I'm interested in the Jaguar. How many miles does it have?","I'm not sure of the exact miles, but I'm going to guess around $165,xxx"
Is it clean? What kind of shape is the interior and exterior in?,The condition is outstanding for a 2002. The inside leather is nice and clean and the paint outside is decent but expected not to be perfect. Overall in great condition!
"Considering that it's a 2002 with at least 165K miles, I am willing to offer $2450.","It has some modern upgrades including security, bluetooth and auxilary, and everything is functionally sound. How about $3250?"
If you deliver the car I'll take that price.,"For $3250, I can definitely deliver!"
"Yes, I am. Is it new in box?","Yup, we receive them unlocked so it's in mint condition and we're really just an authorized resaler. What's your budget?"
My budget is between $525.00- 650.00.,"Oh okay, so 680? I'm not sure I can go lower without upsetting my manager because these sell pretty quickly."
Does it come with the ear buds and charger?,"Of course, it's all set in the box. I can even include a screen protector and case."
I am interested in the tv. How is the picture on it?,Picture is amazing and has HDMI included as well
Great! The price is a little steep for me. How about 100?,How about $120? Its almost like new piece and works really well

Hello. I was just going over the details. I just have a few questions if that is okay.,"Yes, please ask."
The listing states this is a rare bike. Is it durable enough to ride or for a collector?,It;s durable enough to ride on.
I am interested in the bike but I don't know that I have 700. Would you consider 400?,I can't do $400. Would $570 work for you?

That bike looks great. Why you selling it?,Hello! It's a great bike - it's barely been used. Unfortunately I just don't get the use out of it that I thought I would - I think someone else will enjoy it more!
Well I'd love to take it. But the price seems high since the pedals aren't Included.,"This is true! I'm willing to negotiate. It's barely used and in great condition, like new. How's $2500?"
I think 2600 is good for the bike. Pedals run me 300. So how about 2300?,"I'd love to be able to sell it to you - but with it's condition I think $2300 is a little low for me. How about $2430, but I'll drive it over to ya? :)"

"Can we do $100 for the phone w/charger and the case? Thanks but no thanks on the earbuds, I'm a bit of a germaphobe.","Yes, but you have to pick it up if tht's ok with you."
I am interested in your car.  What is the best offer you have received?,"I had an offer of 17000, that's a bit too low for me, as I need to pay my debt off."
Thats too high for me. I can offer 14000 today cash,"I can't go that low, how about 16000?"
I can do 15000 and throw in a free fridge that is like new that I was going to sell,Sounds good!
I'm interested in knowing more about the china hutch you have for sale.,It is a Vintage piece. It's on the small side so it would fit a small space easily.  I am asking $150 for it.

Many of the perks don't pertain to me. I'll offer you $850.,That is too low. How about if you pay 1500 i'll waive the deposit.
"Deposit? I got an 800 credit score. Fact is you should be throwing in the first month for free. Bur, I'm on abudget. My final offer is $1100.","Okay, how about I throw in the first month rent for free and waive the deposit but you will have to pay $1200"
Hello there! How are you doing?,I'm doing well thanks. You shopping for  a new place?

"Sweet I'd love to to that, seems like the perfect place! I better jump at the offer while it lasts!",that's the attitude!
"There you go, thats my offer, my roomate will be sending the other half.",um no you have to get the roommate yourself. the rent is still 2200

No its very pricey. I am looking to fit in a budget of around 9000?,"The car is in very good condition, it's clean and has been well maintained. It comes with bluetooth, auxillary, keyless ignition, and some great tires already installed. The lowest I can go is 11 thousand"
"I can't do 11000. It does not fit into my budget. I am just a student, and looking for something affordable.","I can meet you half way, its the best I can do."
Hello!  SO what are you selling,"I've got an Ottoman, so I hope you're in the market for an Ottoman."
An Ottoman what? Whatever. $140,"At $140, would you be willing to come pick it up?"
Sure why not.,"Okay, great, because these days I feel paranoid any time I'm making a deal online."
"That's normal, please accept","See, I feel like I'm being watched, and whenever I try to make a deal online, it seems to fall through unless I spend a LOT of time negotiating a price, and the details of the trade. I almost feel like I'm expected to spend 5-10 minutes on every trade? Do you ever get that feeling?"
Not at all.  I suggest you seek help at a mental health professional immediately.  But not before mailing my Ottoman thingy to a neutral address,"Sure, sure, I'd be happy to mail you the Ottoman."

Haven't used it in years but always clean it up and make sure everything is good on it every spring and fall. It has new chain and tires. This bike is well worth the money.
It is a beautiful bike. Any rust?,No rust at all. Even has new paint on it! I always touched up on paint in case it was chipped or anything from getting it out and replacing chain and tires
I am very interested. Would you take 85 if I came and picked it up now?,How about $90 and I will give you a new seat and some accessories for it that can be used with your phone and a bag that holds personal items.

"How about $30, but you deliver it for free?",I can do that!

I've just been through a nasty divorce and I really need an affordable place to live. I'm trying to find a place around $900. I have excellent credit and a steady job.,That's great to know but I'm afraid we can't do 900. We could do 1195 and include utilities.
Hey would you do maybe $3,Umm...I was thinking more like $5  It's in great condition
"Right, but nowadays with smart phones, I don't really NEED the remote. How about $4",$4.50 and it's yours
i noticed the car has 130 miles on it.  7000 seems a bit steep. how's 6000 sound?,Well 130k is only 10k a year so that is pretty low all freeway miles as well.  I might be willing to take 6800 for it.  But as you can see this car is very well take care off.
"I don't know. my last car was well taken care of too, but after I bought it, it started falling apart. I am afraid it will be the same deal. ...  it does look ok though superficially. Maybe 6200?",Ahh Was your last car a Honda?  These cars last a long time.  I might go as low at 6700 with a full tank of gas
Yes.  How long have you had it?,My brother gave it to me last year
My grandson has been begging for one.  Would you take $200 for it?,"Well the good news is it's easy to fly so he'll enjoy it. I could do $300, we barely flew it and I have some accessories to give with it"
I have a digital camera that I just recently purchased for my grandson.  It's a 16 megapixel camera.  I'll toss that in as a trade and I'll give you $270 in cash.,"Okay, that sounds good"

Yes,It's still for sale! Do you have any questions?
How old is it?,It is 2-3 years old.
and is the ride smooth with it?,"It depends on where you are riding it, but for the most part it is a smooth ride."
Are you willing to accept 1050 for it?,That's  a little low as it is in excellent condition. I would let ie gor for $1350 if you were able to pick it up.
okay that works for me since its a great bike and something that i have been looking for motnhs,Okay!
"Hi, the lamp is still available.  Are you interested?","I'm selling a Fitbit flex, and yes it is still available."
hi I am interested in your bike that is for sale,Hello
Hi how ar you?,Hello I'm good. Are you looking to buy this?
Yes I am very interested what is the condition is there any damage how are the tires?,It is in good condition. i did use it so it isn't brand new. But I did just change the tires.
Ok awesome look i only have 72 bucks to my name will you take that if i come pick it up asap?,If you can get it tonight I'll make you that deal.
"Hi, it's going good. And with you? Yes, I am interested in the bike.",I'm doing good! Let me tell you this bike is a decked out Santa Cruz Chameleon Custom. You can come take it for a ride and I guarantee you will fall in love with it.
"I would like that, it is a bit of a drive for me. Can you tell me, has this bike ever been in an accident? Any marks or scratches?",Never crashed it and no marks at all. It's only about 3 months old. I'm looking to sell it for $850
"Can you tell me, are the extra set of street tires new? How much tread is on them both?",The tires on the bike are in great condition. The extra set was only used for about a week so they are basically new.
How long have you owned the bike?,3 months.
Are you the first owner? I am very interested in the bike.,I'm the only owner!
"Okay, great! Are you willing to come down on the price some? I am serious about buying this bike. However, like I said, it is a bit of a drive for me to come and get it.","Well, these bikes retail for $2,200 and I'm throwing in an extra set of tires. I think that the asking price of $850 is a steal."
That is a bit steep considering the travel it involves to come and buy it. I am serious with cash in hand.,"If you have the $850 and are ready to buy, I will bring it to your doorstep."
Could you do $750?,I could but I'd have to take out the extra set of street tires.
How about $790 with the extra set of street tires included?,You got yourself a deal.
Just got into biking.  This looks like it might work for my type of car.  Is price negotiable?,Biking is the best! Unfortunately this model wont work for my car. Price is negotiable.
Where do you live?  Can I pick it up?  CAn you thrown in shipping for free?,I'm not comfortable with disclosing my location but I would have no problem throwing in shipping for free if you'll agree to $15!
So it got some issues. I'll tell you what. Seeing as how it's missing the cap and not as sturdy on one side... I'll give you 85 for it,Could you do 90? And we have a deal.
90 it is.,Done.
"Hello, I am interested in your service.",nice unlocked phone

How about 30>,ok
hi,hello
how many stories is this unit,This unit is on the middle level of a three bedroom. It is very well maintained with lots of natural sunlight. Asking $1700.
"Hey there, nice table",Yes indeed it is beautiful
Does the table come with mugs or coasters? It looks so stylish. My budget is 500 dollars.,This is a beautiful Paul Frankl Black Stepped Coffee Table asking 500 is an insult. I would  go no lower than 900 dollars. Remember if you keep it in the condition i give it to you in it will increase in value.
"Yeah you're right 750 sounds like a really good deal to me too, I can pick it up in my pick up truck",Sounds good
This coupe looks nice are you willing to negotiate the price?,Yes make me an offer
2000,3000

"Hey, you have a decent TV there",Thanks.  My girlfriend is moving in so I don't need it anymore.

Hello,Hey there are you interested in my 4 bedroom house lease?
"No, I would like to buy cocaine from you","Uh, im not selling that... But the house is $1900 if you're actually interested. its a great location and no credit check needed.. you can lease for anywhere from 1-5 years or you can buy the property if you like."
"That is quite cheap. I will offer you $15,000. That as high as I can go.",alright deal.
I'd like to offer you $122 for the ipad,I can't go that low. It's barely used. I'll do $175.
"when you say gently used, what exactly do you mean?",It's less than 8 months old. No noticeable wear on it. Used for about 5 hours a week.
I feel like $175 is way too high though.,A brand new iPad 2 would cost you $400
yes definitely,I've got one... barely used. I can sell it to you for $175. A brand new one would cost you $400.
yes but I can find a used one for 150 or less.. would you be willing to do 140,No. The lowest I can go is $170.
how about 160,Meet me at $165 and you've got a deal. A GREAT deal.
"Hi, I'm interested in your bike. It's a little larger than I'm looking for, but I like the style. Would you consider accepting $150?","Hello, do you have any questions about the Bike?"
Will you sell this for $150?,"No, I am willing to negotiate but that is too low. Do you have any questions about the bike? It is really in good condition."
"I think the price is a little high, I can buy a 21-speed new for $350, and that includes a warranty. What about $165?","You haven't even asked any questions about the bike. If you had you would know that it has CST 700X38C hybrid tires, Schraeder valves, Rear Shimano Altus derailleur with MegaPulleys... and many other great feaures. So, as you can see this bike has many great upgrades making it fully worth the asking price of $200.."
"I'm familiar with this model of bike, my brother had one just like it. You didn't mention those upgrades in your listing though, that does add a little value to it. I'm still not sure that it's worth quite $200 though considering what I can buy new for a similar price. I'd be willing to raise my offer to $150.",That is why I kept asking if you had any questions. I'm a bit concerned you're just a reseller looking to undercut other buyers and then make a profit. If you want a new bike without all these great upgrades you should definitely get one. But all things considered I think I'd better not accept such low offers right now. I can go $195.
"Hi, I'm interested in buying your furniture fixers. Are they still available?","Yes, thet are still available. My asking price is $30.00."
Would you be willing to take $25? I can meet you today and pay cash.,"I was really hoping for $30.00, as there are 3 boxes of them."
"Okay, how about $27? I can even throw in some free movies in the movie theater. I'm the manager so I keep them handy.",What type of movies is it? Is it a pass type of it? Restrictions?
"No restrictions save opening day on new releases, other than that you can access any movie and get a free popcorn and drink with it. It just depends on what movie you want to see really.  It doesn't have any expiration date.","Okay. $27 with pass, cash today. Can you do before 5:00 pm?"
Hello!,Hi do you have any concern with the bicycvle
"I would like to know a little more about it. How old is it and what kind of condition is it in, please?",Its in a very good working condition just minor unnoticeable  scratches on the body. Andf i have used it for 3 years. bought it new
Sounds good to me. I can offer you 1050 cash and I can pick it up today. How does that sound?,"Great bargain but low. I will include the brooks saddle and pedals and can give it to you for $1,200. I think this is fair enough"
"Hi, I'm interested in the table! Is it damaged?","It has normal wear and tear, but no significant damage."
It looks sturdy. Is the table homemade or did you buy it from a store?,I purchased it at a store about 2 years ago. It is indeed very sturdy.
Great. Would you be able to accept $45 for it?,Would you be willing to meet at $50?
That sounds reasonable. Sold!,"Awesome, thanks!"
Since itt is rather small (655 s/f) would you take 1095?,"That's too low, my wife would divorce me and I would be homeless so I'd have to live with you. How about 1700?"
"i can do 1700 if all other fees (such as security deposit, pet fees) are waived.",Agreed!
"Hey there, I am interested in your bike.",yeah this is a nice bike i have to many and decided to sell this one i can't sell it to cheaper than the listed price so if you make an offer don't go to far away from that price
Right now i am just looking for a present for my brother's birthday. My budget is around $2500...Do you do 2500? I have saw another bike ad they only sell it for 2300 for almost same condition.,i would'nt be interested
what would be your lowest price?,go to wall mart then
how much would you go down to?,$3500
I can go pick up myself - no need any shipping cost. Can you do 2900?,i would'nt be interested $3500 are no deal and that includes you picking it up
3500 is way over my budget. I think i will pass. My absolute lowest is 3000,finale deal is 3500 take it or leave bub
"Hello, I was interesting in your TV stand. I was wondering it there is any damage or markings from use?","It has been lightly used, but there is no significant damage to the item."
Is it a smoke and/or pet free home?,"Yes, we live in a small apartment and we aren't aloud to have pets or smoke indoors."
Would you be willing to do 55$ and I can pick it up today?,"No, I don't think I can sell it for less than $100."
"I can swing 62, I did find it online for a bit less but its a longer drive for me to get that one.",The best I can do is $80 and a case of beer.
70$ and a 12 pack?,"No thanks, I'll take my chances and let the ad run."
Hi this home really caught my attention. I really need it. Are you willing to sell it off?,Are you interested in the house? Yes I am.

The price that I would want to pay is $2086?,How about $2200 and I will throw in free internet and cable?
Well that's a big thing for me if you thrown in free internet and cable. When can we sign the deal?,"I will offer the $2200 now,thanks enjoy your new home."

"Hello, I am interested in these speakers. However without knowing the current working condition I would be willing to offer you $40","They are working great, I can have you try them when you get here, but I cannot let them go for less than the listed price"
Hi do you still have the furniture fixers?,Yes. I still have them
Do these things really work,Yes.  They really do work.  I recently bought new furniture so I don't need them any more.
Ok I have a couch that is just shot as far as the springs go.  Would you be willing to take $20 for them I had to pay rent this week so I am a little short on funds?,I really needed 30.00 for it.  I'm willing to negotiate but 20 is a little low.
Could we meet in the middle at say $25 then?  I can come get them right away.,26.00 and we have a deal
Ok I can do $26 Thank You,Thank you.  See you soon.
I'm interested in the item you have,Great! for 35 dollars I can deliver it to you
I was only looking to spend about 25 dollars would you consider that?,If you're willing to meet in the middle at 30 I'll still deliver it.
What is the condition of this item?,Like new
Do you still have the Toyota for sale?,Yes I still have it. Are you interested?
Yes. What kind of condition is it in and does it have any mechanical problems?,It's in really great condition. It has 106k miles but these are mostly highway miles so the engine runs like it's lower miles than that.
Okay then. The price is a little high are you willing to negotiate?,I can negotiate a little bit but that's really a pretty reasonable price already. What were you thinking?
Are you willing to go down to 8000?,"No that is way too low, it's worth much more than that. How about 13500?"
That is too high. I don't think it's worth that much given the mileage. How about 10500,Since the engine is in really good condition that would really be too low. 12500 is the lowest I can go.
"Hello, I was contacting you to see why the 2 Bedroom was so expensive.","Actually if you look at comps, this is very reasonable. It's a beautiful property, fully renovated with all new appliances and amenities. You are welcome to come tour the place. You will love it!"
"It looks really nice but there is no way I can swing that much, especially when its so far from down town.  I was hoping I could get it for around $2000 a month.  I can do a cash advance.","With 1 year lease, we can offer $200 discount a month but we can't go any lower."
"Sorry I can't afford that, I can do 2750 if that's ok with you.","With one month rent in advance, we can go $100 more discount with 12 month lease which is $2850. Really that's the best we can do."
Ok.  Lets give it a shot,Great.
Do we wait now?,HI! I have 2 bar stools for sale that are in excellent condition. I am asking $75 for the pair with pickup.  Would you be interested?
"I like that bike, but am on a budget. Not sure if you are negotiating today?","I am always negotiating, my friend. I'd like to make back the cost of the bike, so the bottom floor is 2100. What's your budget?"
"What I am working with today is $1250, is there anything wrong with the bike, how old is it?","It's about 5 months old, I build bikes as a side hobby. To be fair the bike would cost 5000 retail, which means 1250 isn't really approachable unfortunately."
"I know, well would you consider 1800 if can give you cash by tomorrow, and pick it up?",Sounds good
"wow, great car",Thanks. Good price too
Pretty good. How many miles does she have?,Is only has 115k miles on it.
Whoa. That's a lot of driving! Are you a bounty hunter?,"Nah, but the car is runs like new. You won't have to worry about any problems with the car."
I have about 2700 to spend. So you're saying you aren't a bounty hunter? Because...,"hmm 2700 is too low it is in year 2003. How about 3000? I take care of my car really good change oil regulary, check up etc.."
Hi how are you doing?,Hi! I see you're interested in my bike.
"I'm doing just fine, thanks for asking.",I'm selling this great bike for $375. Its high quality and has been custom painted. It is just too small for my build.
"I see it looks pretty nice, so there is nothing wrong with it?",Nothing at all. It has never been ridden.
"That sounds great, would you be willing to negotiate on your price a little bit, I could pay in cash and come by today?",Sure. How much were you thinking?
"I was hoping to pay like 250 but that's pretty low, I think I could meet you at like 300 and pay in cash?",$300 would be great.
tell ya what. i'm willing to give you 35 for the calculator.,I'll do $40
"if you throw in some batteries, you have yourself a deal",deal
"Beautiful tables!! Do you know if they were cut from the same tree. It is super important for the Feng Shui of the room that they are siblings. I like to keep nature happy, you know?","Unfortunately I don't know. I bought them from the same antique shop ages ago, so it's possible, but I don't want to make promises I can't back up."
"Bummer. I still like them. I can probably perform a tree ritual before picking them up. Is $60 a solid number, because it seems kind of angry. Are you willing to be more flexible so we can find a more harmonious number?","I could go as low as 50, below that I think I could probably get more."
Hi! I saw your listing for your table and am interested in any details about it?,Well the listing has all the details. Its a large desk though and very good quality. You can ask me if you have any questions?
Do you know what kind of wood it's made of?,Solid wood that's what I know. I Can give you more information after contacting the manufacturer if you will
Your asking price is way too high for me. The table looks like its worth much less than that. It looks flimsy and looks like particle board on top thats why I asked. The most I can offer is $120. I'll pick it up.,Well you can have a look at it when you come. I can assure you its a great piece of equipment and definitely you won't regret it. I am sorry I can't go that low. The quality is amazing. I can give it to you for $150 as the last price.
Good morning.  Can you tell me about the mountain bike you have listed?,"Sure. Shame to let it go because of how much I love it, but it's great if you wanna go downhill. It has a raceface handlebars and stem evolve, WTB seat, moto and cranks and Maxxis high roller tires."
How long have you owned it for?   Are you the original owner?,"That's right. It's mine only, and I've owned for about a few months give or take, so it's not in the worst condition at all. How much are we willing to negotiate?"
"Well, $800 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay, but would you be willing to consider an offer of $650 if I were to come and pick it up?  Might save you a little bit of hassle....",That s a lot lower than I hoped it would be. I want to sell it for $775 because of how close it is to that of a brand new bike in terms of quality.
Hmmm....How about $725?,"How about 750? $25 extra shouldn't be too far of a stretch from your current offer, no?"
Yeah.  OK.  I'll do $750 if you're willing to deliver it to me.  How about that?,I'm willing to deliver to you! Sounds good to me!
Hi I'm interested in your bike.,Hello. It's a great bike. It's a collectible. I'm wanting $180 for it.
"Ok, but I'm worried about the rust, do you know if it's gone through the frame?","No, it's purely cosmetic. A fresh coat of paint will fix that right up for you."
Well it's a little more work than I care to take on. I'd like to get it for $90. I'm probably going to have to take it to a restorer.,It really won't need much work at all but I do have some wiggle room. $90 is just too low for the collector's item. I could take $160 for it.
I'll bring my offer up to $110 but do you have a helmet I could have. Safety first and all that.,Ok. I'll take $110 for and throw in the helmet.
Hi.  I'm interested in your fire tv stick.,"Yes, this is a brand new Amazon Fire Stick with all the Add ons."
I see that it's jailbroken.  Would you take $45 for it?,These are about $40 plus tax at the store. What you are paying for is all the extras.  I really cant take 45.  My time is worth more than $5.  I really can't take much less than $65.
That's totally understandable.  Can we meet in the middle at $55?,Would you be willing to do $60?
Hi. I'm interested in the couch and loveseat. I'm concerned it will not fit in my apartment but will give you 400 to take it off of your hands,Well the dimensions of the couch are included in the listing. These are very good couches it's actually one couch and a love seat and 2 matching ottomans for only $500 so how about I bring it down to 475
how about we split between 400 and 475 and do 450. That's the best I'll do.,Okay 450 and we have a deal as long as you come to pick them up and move them yourself.
"Hi there!  I saw those lamps you have posted, and I love them!  Do they both work?",Yes they are both in working condition!! this is a great value for vintage lamps
That's great to hear.  Is there any damage to the lampshades?,No damages considering how old they are
Would you be willing to accept $35 for the pair?,considering how vintage they are I don't think I could do $35 are you willing to offer an bit more...trust me these are very nice lamps for their age
"If I give you the full price of $40, would you be willing to deliver?",yes I can deliver if you pay full price and cash
Hello,Are you interested in checking out the touareg?
"Yes, how many miles are on it",70k
When was the last time it was checked out by the dealer,I last had it serviced at VW dealership in May
"Hi. I am interested in your headphones but it seems like you are asking for what they cost new, and it appears they have some damage. I was hoping to pay around 30$ for them.","I bought them for 300 at Best Buy and I'm not sure what damage you're talking about, they are in excellent condition"
It says in the description they are missing one of the metal shields to one side of the headphones. Also the case has some scratches. I could do 45$ I suppose...but not anywhere near 90,"Okay, they're professional quality so if that's not what you're looking for they're not a good fit for you. Thank you"
yes i am,Great it is of the highest quality. Looking to sell today.
how much,$138.
"thats a little more than I can spend, can you take anything less?","Well considering this newer, I can't go down that much. If you're paying cash, how about $115?"
"Ok I can pay cash, but I only have $110, will that work?",Sure. You have a deal.
"Hello, I am interested in your TV. Are there any scratches on the screen?",No scratches on the screen.  It is 10 years old but was up in a mount the entire 10 years.  I also just installed a new lamp in it.  Works and looks like new.
OKay great--so there's definitely not any dead pixels?,None at all. You can test it before purchase to verify.
I would love to. Are you willing to negotiate since it only has 2 HDMI ports? I was thinking $245,That sounds fair to me.  And you're able to come pick it up today or tomorrow?
I am looking for a 2 bedroom apartment,Well I have one how perfect.  It is a beautiful property and better than an apartment because you are going to get your own garage and backyard.  There is also a community pool and clubhouse in the gated community.  We are only asking 1800 a month with an equal deposit
Wow.  Sounds great but my budget was under $1000 a month.,there is no way that I can go that low but we may be able to work something out.  Let me ask how is your credit?
Oh my credit score is pretty good.  750,And I assume you have good rental references?  Also would you be willing to sign a 2 year lease or longer?
"I would love to sign a lease, but I don't think I could pay more than $1,200 a month right now.  I am still in school for the next year",Well if you would be willing to sign a 2 year lease I could come down as low as 1400 a month and with your great credit I will also be able to waive the security deposit.
"I would appreciate the security deposit being waived.  Why don't we meet in the middle, anyway $1,300?",I can do 1300 Congrats you have a new townhouse
will you take 11200?,HI are you interested in my vehicle it is in good condition
"Hello, I was looking around to rent a place and was wondering what are your lowest options, I am on a strict budget?",Really The lowest I can go is$900
"That might work for me, can you offer any free months rent or anything like that?","Well I do need some handy work done around the place, minor maintenance. If you can help for the first month I'll give you a month free. How's that sound?"
I am interested. What are you looking for?,I was hoping to get 60 dollars for it. It is in good condition and the tires are almost brand new.
"I understand that. However, I do see that I'll need to replace the chain and put air in the tires, so that's a bit of a disadvantage to me. How about $50?","50 dollars might work. I can only accept cash payments though, Is that alright with you?"
That's fine with me. I'll agree to 50 in cash only.,That will be fine. Let's do it.
howdy partner. that's an interesting receiver,Hello I have a wonderful piece of stereo equipment here for you and it's a great deal at 100?
"eh, i've seen similar for lower price. it's only 80W?","Yes it is a 80 watt, I am authorized to negotiate some but I can't go too low or my sale won't be approved, what are you willing to offer?"

"Hello, I'm interested in your Civic, can you tell me more about it?","Good little car, great gas mileage. Only 60k original miles. I used it to commute to back and forth to work. No issues that I can think of, just a nice little car that is cheap to drive."
What kind of gas mileage does it get?,I am averaging around 30 city/ 37 highway.
"That's good, but I'm not so sure I want to pay so much for such an old car. How about $4600?","I couldn't come down nearly that low. Car is in great shape, and only 60k miles. This car is good for at least another 140k miles, perhaps more with really good care. I could come down to $6000 if that helps you."

Yea,What kind of phone do you have available for this trade?
Hello,Hello! So you're looking for an apartment?
No the house,"I'm sorry, that's what I meant. I have a great single family house for rent that I think would be perfect for you."
But you don't know me,This house is perfect for everyone.
"You mean anyone. Anyways, don't worry I'm interested.",What price were you looking to pay?
"Free, I'm only kidding honey. Listen, I'm wondering if this community is diverse. I'm a single gay father, and I just divorced my wife. Are you still sure this place is perfect for anyone?","Yes sir, this is a nice house for rent in a quiet and safe neighborhood. There are two large master bedrooms and two other single bedrooms with a total of three bathrooms. The house is great for a small family."
"Right, but I'm not really in a family anymore. I will have my daughter occasionally, is it near schools?",It's easily walkable to schools.
"Oh that's nice. I work from home, I'm making a new business so I was thinking it could double as a place to work out of. I don't think with the divorce I will be able to pay what you want.","The house is listed at $3500 per month, but there's a special going on right now for $2900 per month. I take it that's a bit out of your price range?"
"Honey, everything is out of my price range. My wife is Christian. My daughter is 14 and not into having a gay father. Anyways, this house has what I need to be a responsible father in contemporary society. Maybe we could do a 6 month lease at one price and then negotiate further. I have immaculate credit.",Sounds great. Make an offer.
"Right now, I now I could give you 2000 per month easy...",That works well.
Is that the actual picture of the bike?,"Yes, that is the actual bike in the photo."
Do you know the height?,"Not exactly, but it should work for kids around 3 ft tall"
Does it have a hand brake or a brake on the pedal?,Hand brake
Warranty still available?,Yes
Shipping included in the price?,"No, local pickup only."
I'll assume you are close by to my location.,"Yes, for our purposes. Sure."
I would like to make an offer.  The color isn't what I was interested and I really would prefer a foot versus hand brake for safety.  Do you have any flexiblility on your price?,"Please do make an offer. I have some flexibility, but not much."
Hi. I am interested in your digital sound processor,"Okay! Its brand new, still in box. Thats why im asking 500 for it."
I understand that it is brand new but $500 is a bit high. how does it enhance the sound in my car?,"It fits right in and will make your whole car loud. If you can come pick it up I can drop down to $400 for it. They retail for $500, so its a great deal since its unused still in box."
hi there,hello
how are y ou,Good. Are you interested in the house?
"yes i am, what are some of the good features",very convenient to bus and BART station
I'd like to offer you 400 for this bicycle.,I cannot do $400 but I could do $500 if you have cash.  This bike is a $3000 bike but I am not racing any more and it needs a good home.
Good thank you.,So i have a BEAUTIFUL apartment available it has all utilities AND internet INCLUDED in the 1500 dollar price. It is in a premium area and is only a 7 minute walk to the BART station so you can get anywhere!
"I can tell by the photo that the apartment is in good shape, however I think that 1500 for that area is a little steep.   Would you be willing to negotiate the price with me?",I can go a little lower does 1250 suit you a little better?
"I can tell that you have kept the apartment in pristine shape and really seem to care about it.   I am an excellent tenant and will treat the property as if it were my own.  My budget only allows for 1050, but I can also mow the lawn and do the outdoor upkeep if you are willing.",Yes that will work perfectly now i wont have to arrange for upkeep of the lawn!
Hi there,Hello. How are you today?
good thanks.. I am hoping to make a deal on the battery..,Sure.As you can see they are original battery and absolutely great! What is the amount you are willing to pay?
My absolute highest is 114... is ther enayway that works?,That's too low for me. I got the battery for $180. Its very low for me.
120 would over budget but I would think reaosnable...,Okay I can accept $120 because I am willing to sell it off
"It looks nice, but I really don't think it's worth what you're asking.","How come? It was very well maintained through our company, everything runs perfect on it. Just like new."
It's 6 years old and that mileage seems high. If it was a company truck that could mean a lot of wear and tear. The engine and trans could go out at any time,"The company has maintained it very well, the transmission shifts good. As you know even a high mileage truck, if maintained well, will last you forever."
"I understand. But even with it being maintained well, these things are going to happen. I'll offer $4,000","4,000 is too low. I'll be willing to give you a 1 year warranty on the engine and transmission if that's what is concerning you."
"I'll come up to $5,500. With a 2 year warranty","I'm sorry, I'm willing to work with you but $5,500 is not acceptable. How about $8,000 with a 2 year warranty. We'll even throw in a toolbox for the back!"
"Definitely can't do 8. I'll do $6,300. That's my final offer.","If you can come up with $7,500 I think we can approve that amount. I'll pend you an offer. Think about it. Thank you for your time either way!"
Hello!,Hey get this while you can for just $99 for brand new!
"I definitely am interested, have you tested these speakers by chance? I would like your opinion on how the subs sound in the car if you have.",We also do instillation so yes! You won't get better than these subs. Picks up the low and high tones and sounds great.
"Awesome! I'm pretty good with installing stereos, if I skip the installation, is there any chance I could get a lower deal on these? Somewhere around $85 - $90?",Are you sure pretty good instal is what you want? Because I could go $95 which would give you expert instillation along with a great set of subs.
"$95 seems pretty reasonable, and a professional installation does sound much more reliable. I can definitely go with $95.",Awesome!
Hi! I saw your posting for the wall mount. I'm willing to buy it for $50,That's a little low. How about we meet in the middle at $70?
What if I pick it up from you and pay $60,65?
65 sounds great!,Alright
"Hi, I am interested in your listing",Alright perfect! Both lamps are in perfect condition and are beautiful lamps. I'm wanting to sell both for 70. They usually go for $40 each
"I love your bike however id have to buy a new seat for it, i like the ""kushy"" kind....are you willing to knock 60bucks off?",Well I am selling it for 700 so I can give it to you for 640?
great . please accept my offer,You need to write otherwise it won't be accepted. The conversation needs to go longer a bit!
Hello? I'm interested in the lovely home you have rent.,Hi!  I'm happy to hear of your interest in the property.  Do you have any questions that I can help you with?
How much are you asking for rent?,"It is listed at $2995, but I'm willing to work with the right tenant."
"I'm on  a budget, and would like to go down to 1497.","I know what it's like to be on a budget, but $1497 is just too low.  It is recently updated and is 3 bed/1 bath.  It also includes a washer and dryer in to $2500."
I like the idea of the washer and dryer. Are you willing to work with the deposit?,"Yes, that is negotiable.  I'd be willing to bring the rent down to $2500/month with a deposit of half ($1250)."
Sounds great to me!. I accept the 2500.,Excellent.  We have a deal!
Is the drone still available?,It is
It is listed as being like new. Does it have any replacement parts?,"All accessories, including propeller replacements are included"
Does the batter still hold a good charge?,The battery has only been used a handful of times and still holds a good charge.
fantastic. WOuld you accept 650 for it?,That's a little too steep of a discount. It's almost brand new.
"OK, how about 675?",How about 725 and I can spend a couple of hours teaching you how to fly it?
"That sounds fun, you have a deal.",Agreed
Hello! I'm interested in your cocktail tables. Are you the first owner?,"I am, in fact I had them made custom for a party where space was at a premium for the number of people. I don't really have use for that type of table any longer, that's why I need to sell them."
How long ago did you have them made?,Just a few months ago.
Were they out in the elements?,No they've been kept in a shed on my property. They're in perfect condition. I'm asking $75 for them.
Do they fold down?,"No, not really, they are solid iron frames with wood tops."
I would need to borrow my friends truck to get them. Would you be willing to go down to $60?,"I can do $65 if you come get them, or I can drop them off if you're not too far away, for the full $75."
Hey there! I'm interested in your phone for sale. Why are you selling it?,I have my own and am looking for someone who is looking for a phone that is in excellent condition.
"I'm interested, but $650 is what AT&T charges for the phone new from the store. For that price I get a warranty and know for sure that it's never been dropped, used, stolen, etc. Would you consider selling it for $400? I checked online and that seems to be the going rate.",That might be a bit too low. Would you be willing to pay 500 dollars for it?
Do you have any accessories that you could include?,"Yes, the charger comes free and also a protective case. I wil throw that in for free as well."
I get a charger if I buy it new! If you throw in a nice case I'd raise my offer to $420. Would you happen to have any extra SD cards laying around? I have a ton of music and could use some extra storage!,"Yes, and I will throw that in for free as well. So, do we have a deal? 500 dollars."
If you throw in a case and SD card I'll do $450.,Even better. I will do that. 450. Is it a deal?
I am doing well. I am interested in the ad that you have posted. I see you have several floor plans available?,Yes indeed there are many to choose from all available quickly for the low price of 2250!
"I am interested in a 1 bedroom unit, and am willing to sign a 2 year lease. Are you willing to negotiate on the price?",I can be a little flexible i won't go lower than 2000 though how is 2100?
"I am able to afford $2050, would you be willing to work with that?",Yes perfect
"Hi, I saw your ad and am interested in the item. However the price seems to pricey. Can we negotiate?",How much do you have in mind?
I can pay $10,"I really need more than that, I tell you what, give me $15 and I'll give you some of my wifes fresh chocolate chip cookies"
I can't pay $15. The last I can pay is $13. I think that's a sweet deal.,"I guess I can take $13, but no cookies for you"
Okay and what's the price for the delivery?,"That was only if I got the full price, you'll have to pick it up"
Yes indeed,"Do you have any questions? I can tell you that it has not been restored and the asking price is $135, but I am willing to negotiate."
"Before we talk price, why wouldn't I want this, Whats wrong with it?",I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't want this table. It has the expected wear and tear of it being perfectly vintage but other than that it's a beautiful table with smooth working drawers and a very sturdy base.
Why haven't you bothered restoring it?,"To keep it as vintage as possible, and for the buyer to restore it as they want, should they see fit."
"Well I really can't justify paying $135 for an old side table, I have a budget of $55, so I can do that if you deliver it.","That's quite the drop in price, especially for delivery. I think with delivery added I'll take $100 for it."
"I can do $80 and pick it up, meet you sort of in the middle there.","Well, I think we have a deal then. $100 it is, sir."
"No, $80.",That's right. $80. I'm sorry about that.
I accept.,"Wow, great. Okay I will submit $500."
I am interested in buying your bike. Is it in good condition?,"Oh yes it is. It's got 15"" rims."
If I pay you in cash would you take $80 for the bike?,I would take $81 but that's as low as I can go.
"Hello, I am interested in purchasing your product.",Oh good. Solid coffee table and has a great shelf underneath. Wheels can be removed as well.
Could it fit in the center of an average living room?,Absolutely. It's a med size that can go with any living area for just $45.
"Good, how long have you had it?",Not long just 6 months. Would you like to make a deal and pick this up for $45 today?
Could you go down to 25$,Considering it's age I wouldn't feel good about that but could go $40 and help load it up for you.
What about 35$?,I could do that if you load yourself.
"""El Cerrito""     Im not a bot or solicitor.      Im very interested in the iphone but just dont have the asking price,   any chance you would accept $200 even CASH?",That's really not possible. I'm selling this out of necessity and need a little bit more.
"The fact that my spouse just lost her job and I dont get paid again until 2 weeks from now. . . . Best I can do is $200 Cash.    If you are willing to trade as well,  I can do the $200 cash AND throw you an Amazon Gift Card or Wal Mart Gift Card?   (UNUSED christmas gifts)",That would help if there are really amounts on the cards.
Hello I am interested in this chair. I have a couple of questions first. Did you make this chair yourself?,"Yes I did, with the finest denim in all of the land"
"Was it new denim, or were they someone's funky old worn out jeans?",Someone's LOVELY jeans.  Recycling helps mother earth!
Well I do like to help mother earth... do you have any matching pieces like end tables or night stands?,"ALas, I do not.  It was a one of a kind.  My muse has since moved on to other projects."
"Alright, would you be willing to negotiate the price at all, I could offer about 60 for this chair...",$60 Dollary-Doo's for my sweat and toil?  You wound me.  $82 at least.
Well.. 82 is still a bit too high for me... If I pick it up in person could you consider 75?,I mean I guess.  It's like my first born child...
Hello,"Hello, how are you doing today. My wife and I just bought this bed and we have to relocate immediately and cannot take the bed with us. I am offering it for $900"
"I see it's from IKEA right? Hmm, I am afraid it won't last for a long time",It is a brand new bed and yes it is from IKEA
I know IKEA does not have very quality items. What are the dimensions?,I am not sure of the dimensions but it is a King sized bed and it is brand new.
"Hmm, is delivery cost included in the price?",If you would like we can drop it off for you if you.
"Nice. What is the lowest offer you can accept, I was hopring around 770-780$ cause I am not sure for the durability and quality.",It is brand new and it is a King sized bed. I can do $800 and have it delivered to you today.
It looks super close to the neighbors.,"It is just like other neighborhoods. Not too close, but not a big distance apart."
Original hardwood?  Was it actually refinished or was espresso spilled (splashed) on it?  I'm thinking the later with no pictures inside.,"I can certainly send you inside pictures, or you could stop by the see it before you pay."
The yard is also very poorly maintained... Are you willing to take 1200?,No for the area this is in that is too low.
If you reseed the lawn I can go 1300,I am not willing to go below 2000 for this
"That's just not going to work.  Reseed the lawn, tear out the awful plant up front, and show me it first and I'll give you 1800.",I'm sorry that is just too low for this house. I'd be able to all that for you but only for the price of 2000
Can you tell me about the condition of the chair?,The chair is in very good condition.  It is exactly as you see in the photo.  Like new.
Is it used? Why are you selling it? How heavy is it?,"It is barely used. I am selling because I am moving offices, and all personnel in the new unit must having matching office equipment.  Frankly, I am sad to give this chair up: the lumbar support has saved me a lot of pain."
"Hi, I'm interested in one of these phones. Is it still new in box?",yes everything is new
"Since this is not the newest model, are you willing to negotiate on the price?","ya, drop an offer it doesnt hurt to ask"
Would you take 325 if I pick it up?,"Yeah sure, just one right ? Ill submit the price now"
"Wow, this product looks great!","It's an amazing, antique table with so many uses.  It's got two leaves that make it extend to dining room size, a card table drop, and it's got a pristine finish.  I'm asking 1200"
Thats an awful lot of money. Is it new?,"It was handmade by an artisan craftsman last year.  It's expensive, but it's quality. My wife hates it, though."
"Oh wow, well if she hates it, maybe its not that great. I will go 800.",Nah. She just wants to paint it and I don't want to see that happen to this.  I'll go $999 and I'll deliver it
How about I pick it up for 850?,900 and you have a deal

So it truly is in good condition?,Yes.
"Well, that is good, and for a fair price as well, however I am a little short on money this week. could we agree on $225?","No, sorry, that's too low. I can drop the price to $240 though."
If we lower it to $230 I can assure you that I can pick it up quick.,$240 is the lowest I can go. Can we agree on that deal?
Yes I do. Is there anything that needs fixed on it?,"It is in exceptional condition. We have babied car since we bought it brand new. No kids driving it, just us adults, and we take pride in our vehicles"
"Thats great to hear. Well, I do have two little kids. One is 3 and the other is 2. My husband is the only one working at the moment, so needless to say were on a tight budget. Will you take $5244?","I really cannot go that low. You will not need new tires for a long time, it was just smog checked, and maintence is all up to date and perfect. This car is in PRISTINE shape.

That sounds great.  I'm looking for a two bedroom.  Do you have any available?,"Yes we do! It's going to be $1626 for that. Also I forgot to tell you, there is a very relaxing fireside lounge!"
I was hoping that you would have something along the $1200 range...,"For 1 bed we do, but 2 bed starts around $1626. The lowest we can go is $1600. But remember the first month is free too, and thats not calculated into the price yet."

It sounds like a great car. I can't do $15750 but would you accept $7875?,This car is almost new. i cannot give it to you for half price. I can do $15000 even if you get it today.
I understand. I can't do $15000. Would you go down to $1400?,"No, I cannot. I am already losing money by lowering it to $15000 for you. $14900 and it's yours."

I am interested in the Infinity,"Sounds good, let's negotiate.  Everything is fully working on this car and the sticker price is $15,000.00"
I would like to ofeer 8500,Unfortunately that is lower than I can work with.  This has been a lightly used car and everything is in proper working order.  You'll have to do better than that.
Last offer of 9000 or I walk,"I can do $9800, but if $9000 is your low, then I don't think we can make a deal."

"Hello, I am interested in the speakers you have for sale.","Howdy! Turns out, I'm very interested in selling them. After the updates and modifications for improvement that I've made to the speakers, I feel the $100 asking price is a steal! Would you like to purchase them today?"
How old are they? Do they have any defects?,"Well, they'd be new to you! I don't recall the exact year they were manufactured. Of course, they are meant to have a vintage appearance. I've not had any defects occur but I did feel it was important to make some improvements in the repair of them. Because of these improvements, the overall sound quality is better than the ones you could buy off the shelf!"
Would you take $85 for them? I am a college student and I'm trying to make some side money by using them at house parties where I DJ. These would help me a lot.,"I completely understand the grind, friend. As a college student myself, I'd be willing to take $90 today and I'll be out and about, happy to deliver to a location of your convenience. Fair enough?"

I'm interested in the drone.,It's really an awesome quadcopter and so much fun!
And you said there's never been a crash? Does it come with any spare parts if it would crash?,"The listing didn't include any, but I could throw a few in if you want to buy today. I have a spare body, rotors and an extra sd card."
What's your lowest price?,"Well, what would you be willing to offer with those extras? I'm asking $300, it retails $500 and I'd like new. Not to mention all the extras."
I have $150 cash in hand.,"I can't go that low, would you do $225?"

Ok I can do $250 and I can get it this evening if that is ok?  Say 6-7.,I will be home all nigh so that will work perfectly.
"Hi how are you! I am, but it has alot of miles on it, even with the new groupset, brakes and rotors. I'll buy it for 1200 if you drive it here","1250 and you have a deal, if you have any questions about the bike let me know"
"I'll gladly take it for 1250, you'll deliver right?","Yup, when will you be around?"
How about 600?,"Sure, if you can pick it up."
How tall are these lamps?,"Hello, are you looking yo buy?"
"In the picture the cords look really long, how long are the?","They are not too long, long enough to reach an outlet. Also, they are clear, so they do not draw much attention"
How firm are you in your asking price? Are you willing to come down a little?,I will come down to 175 and I will give you the light bulbs for free
Hey! I think I may want to buy your table.  How much are you asking?,"YOUR SOUL! No, kidding, I own my boyfriend's soul, I don't need yours. It's listed for $575"

hello are you still there,Yes
can you sell me the home for 1750,"No, I'm sorry, but the home is for rent, not for sale."
ok well can you do 1750? 3500 is a bit high for a 3 bedroom,"Friend, this is a high quality home in a very desirable neighborhood. Frankly, I'm not sure why I'm letting it go for $3500. It would be a steal at $4000 a month!"
"thats not a steal because i have to pay security deposit as well, i would basically be paying your mortgage and adding extra money in your pocket,thats a rip off!","Well, you know what they say, being rich enough to rent out a house in California means you get to be cruel, it's just a perk of being rich.  Now, I suppose I could come down to $3,000 a month, that's only $39,000 a year to live in this wonderful neighborhood."
well what is the school district like? is it A rated?,"Yes, the schools in this area are some of the best. I'll tell you what, because it's clear you're interested in the house because you want to spend time hanging around the local schools, I'll drop the price down to $2850 a month."
I have children to think about and if i am going to pay that much for rent i want to make sure i dont have to send them to private school too because the public school in our area is bad. But if you can do 2000 we have a deal,"Okay, you're cutting my throat, but I'll come down to $2,250 a month."
"would that be included with electric, if so we have a deal","Okay, we have a deal."
hello,Hi! Are you interested in the wood armoire? It's a lovely piece that is very versatile and in excellent condition.
"by excellent, you do mean there are no chips, scratches, or signs of warping? How long have you had it?","You are correct. There are no chips, scratches, or signs of warping. I have had it for a year, and it has been lovingly cared for and polished. I'm moving to a smaller place, so I need to sell it."
Understood. The only deterrent for me is that the back it cut out. Ill be putting it in an area where it is visible sideways. I have to reboard the back within the next day. Whats your lowest price?,"I understand. My lowest price would be $60 cash, and you pick it up."
Hello is this item still available?,Hi

"It looks good in the picture, but are there any tears or other damage?  I'm only looking to spend around $175.",No damage whatsoever...it was a great chair while I needed it....

start over,"Hi, are you interested in my apartment? haha"
indeed. is it a good neighborhood?,"It's a great neighborhood.  A couple blocks from the high school, within walking distance of a library and shopping center"
i'm looking to spend about $1700... what do you think?,"Well, that's significantly below market value.  What's your credit score look like?"
805 - i have great credit,"That's really good!  Based on your credit, I can give it to you for half deposit -- $1000 instead of $2000 -- and throw in parking for free.  Would you be willing to do 1900 a month if I do that?"
that is pretty much exactly what i'm looking for. we have a deal,Great!
"hi, nice ride! I am very interested",It IS an absolute classic the interior is all original brown leather that's been well taken care of. It was driven by a 98 year old woman who never took it out it only has 32000 miles on it!
oh wow! that is great! are you willing to go down on price? It seems to be priced a little high,I can go down a little but as i said due to the conditions of the car it's worth quite a bit but i can go down to 10000 for you does that work for such a luxurious beautiful car?
"10,000 works for me. especially since it only has 32k on it! I will head over to the bank first thing in the morning and meet when ever its convenient for you!",Perfect!
"Hi. Well, I was wondering if you could come down on the price. I can pay cash.","Since it's brand new, I can negotate some but I dont want to go too low. I bought furniture too big for my house and will need to buy new ones after this set is sold."
Would you take $600 cash for the set? I can also pick it up. No delivery necessary.,"Thats a little low. Could we do $800? I really wanted $1,000 for the set."
$800 is really out of my budget at this time. How about $700?,"I will take $700, I really need to get it out of the house."
That sounds great. Thanks for being reasonable on the price.,"No problem, I had a typo so you definitily got a steal!"
Hello. Is this item for sale?,It is and at a great price of just $270
Is there any damage done to it?,It;s great condition and really looks almost brand new.
Can I stop by and take a look at it?,You can of course. Would you be willing to for that price?
"Yes I would, but would you be willing to lower it?",I could maybe go $250 if it goes today.
Hi I'd like to buy this for $50,HI I would like to tell you more about the item first
"Ok, please do","It is a mirrored nightstand, which is really fashionable. THe night stand is a little bit damaged as the top drawer has a little bit of resistance while using it. However otherwise it is in perfect codnition. It is a fashionable item to have in any bedroom"
Hm ok.. so would you still take $50 for it? Since it's slightly damaged?,I would like to receive at least 60 for it. My listing price was 75! and this is a really nice nightstand. It goes for around 200 originally!
I will give you $60 for it,great! that sounds good
Hi I saw your ad and am interested.  How much are you asking?,I am asking $1400 everything in excellect condition.
That seems a little pricey.  Would you be willing to accept 1000?,"I would like to get at least $1,150.  Everything is up to date w/granite counters, tile floors and garbage paid as well..  Great location as well."
Okay that's a fair price. I can do that!,Awesome..  Thanks!
"Hi. You've got a nice car. Its used, right? How well did you take care of it?","Yes it is used but it is in pristine condition. It only has 16,473 miles on it and looks and runs like new. I have taken it to the dealer for oil changes and the like."
"Good to know, it should still be under warranties with that number of miles, correct? I like what I'm hearing. How about I give you 18,000 for it?",Yes it does come with a full warranty. It is loaded with extras I was looking to get more like 26000 but would consider an offer of 21000 as that is way below book value. I am moving so I need to sell it. I cannot take it with me.
"I'll come up a bit and work with you, that's fair. 20,000?","20000 would be fine. I will send you an offer! I will also deliver it to you, my friend has a flatbed truck I can bring it on. thanks !"
Hi is the answering machine still for sale?,Yes it is. Are you interested in it?
Yes! Is it brand new?,it is. It's still in the box and has never been used. It was my grandmothers but she didn't know how to set it up so we bought her a cell phone instead
My grandmother is the same way. If I come pick it up from you today would you take $10?,I think we could make that work. But I am leaving hte house now and heading south. Would you be able to meet me downtown at a coffee shop or a cafe in an hour. After that I won't have any time until the weekend.
"Hi. This is a beautiful apartment, but a little pricey for the area. Are you aware that the crime rate has been rising and the schools are starting to fall in their grade quality?",Oh really? This is the first time I'm hearing this. I'm willing to work with you on the price.
"Oh wonderful. I was looking at similar studios that did not pay any utilities and they ran closer to 1800 a month. So I think with utilities, $1850 would be a fair price.",I'd be mroe then happy to accecpt $1850 a month for the property if you signed a lease this week.
Oh. I can definitely do that!!,Awesome! Looking forward to meeting you.
I'm interested in your Iphone,It's a great phone.  It is fully functional and in great condition.

Yes  - I can be there this afternoon with $300 cash in hand,Great!  See you then.
"cool bike, how long have you had it?","I've had it for about 2 years. It was custom made, and I've taken great care of it. I'm looking to sell it for $350."
"Thats a bit steep for me, I'd be more comfortable around $250. Since it will be hard to find spare parts if I need to do repairs","That's understandable, but I can't part with it for that low. I'm willing to sell it for $280."
Can you deliver it or cover shipping costs as well?,"I'll deliver it to you, no shipping. Local sales only."
Great $280 and delivery.,Excllent.
Hi I am interested in your fitbit is it still available?,It sure is. It is in perfect condition and I am only asking $60 for it. Half of what I paid for it brand new.
"Well I do understand that you did pay quite a bit more for it but the truth is, these are only 66 brand new from walmart now.  I would be willing to pick it up right away and pay you $30 for it",That is half my asking price. I'll take at least $50 for them and no less.
For $50 would you by any chance be willing to deliver?,Sure! I'll bring them to you. Just e-mail me your address or a meeting point and I'll head over.
"hey, is the system used",No they are new.
ok,Are you interested in the speakers?
yeah but i only have fifty bucks cut me a deal,If you can pay $80 ill throw in a 50% discount on your next purchase.
can yo do $60 thats all i have my freind,Ill do $60 if you pay in cash and pick them up today.
Yes indeed what condition is it in?,IT is beautiful apartment in upstate new york. We keep it in impeccable condition and only sell to worthwhile clientele so that no one will damage it etc.
I would love your apartment but can pay no higher than 900 dollars a month. Would you accept 3 months cash up front plus a secutity deposit of 700 for a rent of 900 dollars?,"Yeah 1300 does sound good, it's a pretty nice apartment. In addition, the appliances are included including the fridge and stove; and there is a variety of local businesses."
Hello I am interested in your listing,"this is an antique vanity. its gorgeous. I have to move, so have to get rid of it. i'm asking $650"
"It looks nice in the photo, however I am concerned that there seems to be some damage to the finish...","there is a little damage, but it can easily be refinished. I'm willing to drop the price to $600 so that you can cover the cost of the repairs"
"Refinishing is quite expensive, i'm not sure that would cover it. I was thinking more along the lines of about $450","I'll arrange to have it refinished, and pay for that out of pocket, if you agree to $600 purchase price"
That seems overly complicated. I'd rather get the refinishing done myself and not have to put out so much cost upfront.,"in that case, best I can do is $550. take it or leave it"
"You seem kind of rude, so I'd rather not. Thanks anyway.","I appreciate the offer, but no thanks."
"I'm loving your phone.  I wish it were a rose colored, but am interested.  Only thing is I'm on a strict budget and can afford about $130.  Would you be wiling to lower your price?","It is a great phone!  I completely understand being on a strict budget, but I can't go that low.  The lowest I can take at the moment is $270."
Oh man....  Would you be willing to do $170 if I pay cash today?,"Sorry, can't do $170.  I know it's a great phone and will sell for close to what I'm asking."
"I can't go that high.  Sorry.  I'd like to buy a case since I really don't care for silver, but can't if I pay the whole amount. How about $200?",That is still quite a bit lower than I'm willing to accept.  My final offer is $250.  That will give you some extra to buy a case.
"Hi, I seen your Iphone 6 was for sale.  Are there any known issues with it?",No problems.  It is in VG condition and memory wiped clean and phone unlocked.  I am asking $270 for it
That's a bit higher than I would like to spend.  Does it come with any accessories?,It has the wall charger.  I could also include a brand new otter box case that I havent even opened.
Would you consider $200?,I'll tell you what.  I can include the case AND a bluetooth headset that I have if you'll pay $235
Is the headset over ear or in ear?,It's in ear.  Bose.  State of the art
$235 sounds like a good deal.  When can we meet?,I can meet you at the shopping ceneter anytime in the next day
Hello,"Hi, are you interested in purchasing this beside audio player?"
"Yes, I'd like to know high bright the clock is, I'm a light sleeper, and I don't like bright lights while I'm trying to sleep.","The brightness is adjustable, so you can make it as bright or dim as you'd like"
"That's good. $40 seems like a bit much, though.","It's in perfect condition. But I'd be willing to go down to $32, if that works for you."
How about $30?,"Okay, that's reasonable."
"Hello, how are you?","I am well Thanks, How about yourself?"
I am good. I saw your ad and I would love to live there! What is the crime rate like?,The area is phenomenal. I have not heard of many problems at all in the neighborhood.
That is great new.! I see all of the nice amenities that come with it! But 2095 is a bit much for me right now. Could we talk a lower price?,It really is a great price for this place. I could do $2000 flat for you though. There is so much included already. The view is spectacular. An amazing inground pool. Gas is included. You get your very own private balcony.
2000 would be great. I know this is well worth my money. I appreciate it!,"Great, I am looking forward to meeting you."
Do you a Spare Tire?,"Yes, I do, and I'm willing to throw it in the deal for $11500. It isn't as good as the tires on the truck, but it will get you where you need to go if you get a flat."
That's a great one. But want to know if the Car has any accident history? Dont mind if you can give me the chasis number so i check myself,"It's never had an accident. I've babied it. I don't have the chasis number on me, but I'm happy to print out the vehicle history for you when you get here. Do you have an offer?"
"Okay thanks. I can offer $10,000 without any accident history but if i find out otherwise i can change my mind","That's reasonable, and I assure you, there haven't been any accidents."

Yes. Is it a good phone? I do not know much about phones.,"It is an amazig phone. This is an Edge 128 GB SM-925A phone unlocked AT&T , mint condition. Beautiful and clean screen no scratches."

"Hi, how are you doing today?",I'm doing good how about you?

That's great. And is anything wrong with the interior?,The interior is in great shape.  I keep the seats covered and recently bought new covers that I will throw in if you choose to take the Nissan.
That would be awesome. Would you be willing to come down a little on the price?,I'm willing to negotiate.  How far down are you thinking?
I would love if you could come down to 7500,"I bet you would, but that's much lower than I am willing to go considering what a great car this is.  What about $9500?"
What if I buy it today and we make a deal at 9000?,You've got yourself a deal...a great deal!  $9000 it is!

I am interested in the airbed. Is it in good condition?,It is in EXCELLENT condition. We bought for my sister to use while she was visiting. She slept in it for two nights and now we do not have the space to store it.
Yes! it looks amazing!,"It really is. Do you have questions about it? I've taken this boy down so double black trails in Whistler, Canada and it handled like a champ."
"Wow, si its been used often?",Yes fairly often but as you can see from the photos the bike has been very well maintained.
"Yea, that is absolutely true, but can I have a discount?",Yeah we can work something out. So I'd wiling to sell it for it $1150 if you can pick it up from me today
how about 900 if I pick it up and pay cash.,"Eh, $900 is too low for me. The bike has very expensive custom rotors on both wheels. Those alone are worth $500. I can go down to $1100 but that's my lowest."
"How about 10,500? That and its a deal.","Make it $10,700 and we have a deal."
Hi I am very interested in buying your HMDX Flow Bedside audio,"Sure, I am asking 40 for it."
Is it in good working condition and will not break as soon as I receive it?,It's in excellent condition and the sound is amazing. It will last a long time.
40s a little too steep for just the bedside audio. would you take 25 for it instead or add in some extra perks?,"If you can come up with 30 dollars, it is yours. Trust me it's worth the price for this great multi function sound system."
i think 30 dollars would be fine for me,That's great. Thanks
Hi I was interested in your watch and was wondering if you could tell me a little about it?,It's in good condition. I'm asking $120.
Awesome I was hoping to pay a little less if you're willing?,"I need to sell, so I'll hear your offer."
Will you accept 85 for the watch please?,I was hoping to get at least $100.
"Hmmm, Okay I really want the watch so I think I can afford that, send me the offer please.",can you come today and pay cash?
"Um yes, I think I can make it today just fine and yes I will be able to pay you in cash!",Good. Then we have a deal. Thanks.
Hello I am hoping to pay a little less than your offer of 500 and come down to 250 if at all possible can you work with me there?,I can definitely negotiate but $250 i s really low.  I can do $250 if you might have something else to trade too.
"Okay I can throw in some of these fantastic natural and holistic herbs that I got from a shaman while traveling overseas and they are great for the body, you cannot get them in USA.  I can add these and also some weights for you to work out with, do you like?",Perfect we can do that.
Hello!  Great.,awesome!  So you looking for a tv?
Yeah.  What condition is the product you have in?,"It's brand new!  Flawless condition, and still under the factory warranty."
And how old is it?,"ive only had it a couple weeks.  So $1,400 sound good?"
What did you pay for it when it was new?,"1,800"
I can offer you $1100 cash only.,"i could go down to $1300, but I can't go any lower.  This tv won't last long."
"I can offer you $1240, but that is as high as I can go.","ok, that sounds fair.  You got a deal!"
"Hello, I am interested in your car, but the price seems a bit high. Is there room for negotiation?",It is a great car but I am open to a reasonable offer.
"I am just looking at the blue book value, and it priced fairly high. I would be willing to offer you $2,500","I'm afraid I cannot go that low. It is in excellent condition, clean inside out and is a very reliable car. Lowest I can go is $4000."
"Good, so I want to buy the bike, but it's a bit ugly. What's wrong with it?",Absolutely nothing is wrong with it the bike is fully comprised of high end components that are clearly listed in the description i am firm on 700.
"Honestly bikes don't cost 700 dollars. I need you to come down to about $200, and that's a lot for a used bike. If you haven't noticed, the bike market isn't exactly booming,",I wouldn't go near that low the low end bike market may not be booming but this is a high end bike.
I am interested in your calculator?,"Hi, yes, do you have any questions for me?"
Yes what condition is this item in?,It's in like - new condition. I've had it for a month and have used it only a handful of times
If I can pick it up in one hour would you accept 5$,I won't be home. Can you pick it up tomorrow instead? 5 works

Hello there,hi
I saw your ad for the Mazda. Is there any problems with it?,it has a salvage title due to a small accident in the side door and it has already been fixed
Okay. No other accidents?,No other accidents.  mileage 1523
"Okay, That is not bad. I see your asking price is 15700. That is a bit more than what I have in cash. Could we talk about lowering that?","I can do $13000, the mileage is so low it is practically new.  All power, leather interior."
I can do 13000 and can pick it up in the morning if thats ok,ok great
Hi I am interested in your bike.,"Great, do you have any questions?"
I was wondering if you are willing to take 100 less for it? Also where did you keep the bike?,It is garage kept ever since I have owned it. It is top of the line. All new parts and rarely riden. I would not accept 100.00 I would work on my asking price of 1200.00 though
"I was asking if you would take 1100 not 100. Sorry I should have been more specific. Sounds liek a great bike, why are you selling it?","I am just getting to old to ride, and I have no children. I want someone else to enjoy it. I would accept 1100 for the bike, I want someone to own it who wil use it and have fun with it."
I am!,I would be willing to part with it for 140 and i will deliver it to you
That sounds reasonable.,That is great
"Hi, so I AM interested in the iPhones..",which one are all of them
"Your ad is for all of them. So, because I'm buying in bulk, I'm willing to give what a store would for your phones. They seem to be all in okay or bad condition, and I'm going to give $25 each totaling to $100. They're generations old and worthless.",thats not a resonible price ican knock off  40 bucks take it or leave it you can easily make your money back
"I can't because nobody would pay that much, $115 in the middle final offer. I'm not even selling them I'm using them in my house as remotes for various things.",ok il take 140 finale offer
One of the phones has a crack so I'll have to spend $20 for a new atomizer and screen please do $120 It's not worth it.,ok $100 u pick them up
Thanks man,thanks
Hi! Can you tell me more about this bike? How old is it?,This bike is only two years old. A very sturdy bike constructed from steel. Also it is only slightly used as my child who I orignally bought it for hit a growth spurt shortly after.
"Does it have any issues? Flat tires, faulty brakes etc?",No there are no such issues I had sprayed the exposed metal parts with anti rust. Therefore the brakes still function smoothly. As for tires I had recently ensured to inflate back to the appropriate tire pressure.
Would you take $70,That would be a little too low for me. Ihad previoulsy paid around 200 for it brand new so 70 would put me at quite a loss. I could throw in a bicyle bell if that would intrest you.
What about $80 and I'll pick it up?,Would you still want the bell in this case?
No.,Then that would be fine I could also meet you half way if necessary.
"Hi! I love this cellphone, does it has earphones?","Yes it comes with headphones, fast charger, original accessories, and manual"
Nice! what about free shipping?,I might be able to do that if your offer is decent
does it include a case ?,Yes the case im including is only a month old
Hey I am interested in your bike. Would you be able to come down at all with the price?,"Yes I definitely can. I don't have a way of delivering it, so it would be a big help if you could come pick it up from my place. It's in great condition, paint is still good, tires are perfect, very pristine, like new condition."
I've been looking for a Hawaii Beach Cruiser like this. I love the basket on the front. If I pick it up today would 260 be a good enough deal for you?,That would be fantastic. I'll help you load it up into your vehicle. Thanks so much!
good I like the truck you have for sale,"It is a good truck, and you can not go wrong with a Toyota!"
is it good for to drive off road?,"Well it is 2wd, so nothing major off road."
I see that it is banged up on the side. Is there any other damage?,"No, nothing more then your standard wear and tear."
"I can offer you 25000 for it. I've seen similar listed for 25,000 which didn't have body damage.",I think that will work.  That is a fair price!
"Hello, I'm interested in buying your car.",Awesome.  I just had it waxed and it's ready to go!
"Great, how well does the car run?","It has zero issues, drives wonderful."
Have you had any issues with the vehicle in the past?,"Nope, just regular maintenance."
"Sounds great, I am really interested in buying the car.  However, $14500 seems steep for a 2006 with 106k miles.  Are you willing to lower the price a little?","Of course. I posted it a bit high, then I got to looking for prices around.  I'd be willing to go as low as 10k cash."
I'm concerned about some of the cosmetic damage and the price to fix it.  Would you be willing to settle for $8500?,It just has a few wear and tear scratches over the years.  Nothing a bottle of great wax can't fix
"Ok, sounds good, so 10K for a final price?","Awesome, will you be picking it up?"
Absolutely,What time works best for you?
Sunday at 11:00 am,Great. I'll see you down here on 310 N. Main at 11 am.

The apartment has lots of closet space, two bedrooms, large windows that really brighten up the space, and an enclosed patio on the back."
Great. I'm looking for a place in that area. Is a security deposit required?,Right now we have a special . . . $99 security deposit! But you have to take advantage of the offer today!
Would you be willing to go down to $800 for the first month's rent?,"I am sorry, but the rent is $1725 . . . $800 is much too low."
"What about $1,200?","The lowest I can do is $1,650"
"Hello, I am interested in the bike.",Okay. Are you willing to pay the listed price?
"No, that is a bit out of my price range for a used bike.  Are you willing to go lower?",I could part with these components for $1900 with a free delivery to you.
I'm worried about the tires condition after the 1000 miles.  How about $1800?  Or new tires and $1850?,I could throw in new tires and a free delivery for $1875. Does that sound fair?
Sounds fair!,Deal!
"Hello there, I'm interested in your item for sale. Can you tell me what condition the item is in.",the item is in excellent condition and very much portable
Have any of these adapters been used?,None have been used
Does this come with any kind of warranty?,It does come with a warranty card
Excellent. Would you consider taking 9 for it?,That's way too low for the amount of things that you get inside. I am willing to give it for $12 nothing less than that

hello I am interested in the yukon you are selling,"That's great!  It's an excellent car and in great condition.  I'm asking $4,400.  My family and I have gotten a lot of use out of it over the years.  I'm only selling since two of the kids have gone on to college so I don't need such a big vehicle anymore."
"It has over 100,000 miles on it I would like to offer 4000",I think $4000 is fair.  I can do that.  Thanks!
I'm great because I found this awesome item! Are these in good condition??,Super special awesome condition!
I could come pick them up today with $9 cash.,"I don't mind shipping, but it's nice you can offer that"
"I'll either pay $10 if you want to ship, or the $9 in cash today",Really.  That's great.  Are you sure you want to get these gloves?
I really want these gloves!,What do you like about them?
Hi are you still selling that mattress?,Yes I am
What condition is the mattress in?,Its less than 2 years old and super comfortable. It doesn't work for me anymore because I have a huge room and this mattress is for small room.
I see new ones on Amazon for like $220 do you think you could bring the price down at all?,I can give it to you for $190.
That works for me thanks.,Great then! Thanks for the business!

Would you take 340?,I can go down to 400
Slightly out of my budget can we meet at  360?,can you pick it up? If so I can do 375
Done,so 375 then
"Hi, I am interested in renting the apartment.  What are you looking for in rent?",The listing price is 1850 but I do have permission to go a little lower.
"That is good to hear.  $1850 is outside of my budget, so I'm glad you can go lower.  Would you be willing to waive the one time rental fee?","That is possible, just don't tell your friends!"
"I won't!  Since I have to pay gas and electricity, would you be willing to rent the place for $1,500 flat?",The lowest I can go is  1600 and no rental fee. Does that sound good?
It depends on how firm the price is. I'm looking for something more in the 800 dollar range. Unless there's some type of amenities you can offer to justify a bigger price.,"Well you're in luck, we're offering a $1000 off move in special, so the starting price is only $588 right now."
"Well how about this, you throw in a year of parking and I'll offer you 800 upfront.","That works out well. Thank you very much for your interest, I hope you enjoy!"
Hey there,Hello. Are you interested in this item>
Yeah I am.  How used is it?,Its 2 years old. I haven't used it the past 2 years
Are the wheels in good shape.,Yes absolutely they're perfect
"I have cash and if I come pick it up today, will you take 2700.00 or I will give you $3000 if you deliver it.",well i will take the 2700 as delivering myself would be too much work for me.
"HI, i  need a new bed and Serta is a good brand, what shape is it in?","hello, it's in pretty good condition..we've just used it for the guest room so it's not caved in or anything like that"
I see...the price is a little steep for me..Im a poor college student..can you work with me at $175?,"well im moving so I really need to get it out but that's a little low... if you can do $200 I will throw in the sheets and comforter, plus and set of sheets..they're really nice and high quality"
"ok good, I don't have any in that size and I know they cost a lot nowdays...so I can do 200","great, $200 for the bed, sheets and comforter...deal?"
"Hello, I am interested in the bike.","Great, it is in great condition. We always kept it inside and it just has a few scratches on the pegs."
Do the gears shift smoothly and are the tires inflated well?,The tires are great and the gears are incredibly smooth.
I have been shopping around and just through comparison have found several bikes in this price range. If you'd be willing I could pay 150,"I couldn't do 150, could we split the difference and do 175?"
If you could throw in a bike like I'd be willing to do that.,"Sure, I have a bike lock I can include."
"Hello, yes I am very interested. I saw this ad and I thought this would be the perfect Chevy for my granddad.","yes, I am sure he would love it! do you have any questions?"

"So is this new, used or junk?",This is a brand new peice
That photo looks like it's already set up,No it is not set-up that is the factory picture. What you will receive is in a closed box that has never been opened.
I see well all in all then this is still an older model as the gear s3 is now out so Id like to offer 161 for this model in white.,I would accept that offer.
"Hello, I was interested in renting out your 2 bedroom apartment","Excellent. It is a great property in a safe neighborhood. We're looking to rent it for $2311, but we're willing to negotiate on the price."
"I can do $1600, Save you the hassle of doing any more searching and losing money on this space.","Unfortunately, I can't go that low, and there are other prospective renters who have expressed interest. I'm authorized to lower the price to $1849 for someone who is really interested."
$1849 is closer to my price range.  How about I come by this week with $1800 cash in hand and we settle this deal?,I just spoke to my manager and he has approved your offer of $1800 cash.
Would you be willing to sell for $10.00?,"That's just a small bit lower than I would have liked. I'll meet you halfway at $12.50, and I'll deliver it to you personally if that sounds fair enough."
What about $11.00 and I can pick it up from you!,"Actually, that's fine. You've got a deal."
"Hey there! Yes, I saw it online. I'm definitely interested. I also saw that you would be willing to trade for a smart phone? I have an iPhone5 that I don't use. Would that be enough to trade for the amp?",What condition is the iPhone in? Any cracks or scuffs?
"It's got a little chip on the edge, but other than that I always had a case on it so it's in pretty good condition",Okay that sounds fair to me I'll accept that trade.
I am interested in this apartment. Is the price negotiable?,Sure! What number are you thinking?
"The other home I am looking at is 800 dollars a month, but this one is much better. Would you consider 850?",No can do. Have you checked out the amenities package? We'd be taking a loss at that price.
The amenities are pretty extensive. Would you consider more like 1000?,You're at least pulling into the parking lot of the ballpark. :)
1050?,"I know 1448 sounds like a big chunk of change. But we're in California. San Francisco Bay. I'd take 1300. That's nearly 150 off. Our website is ""Waterview"". You can see the water!"
"Also, are they solid wood or veneer?",I can't answer the first question because I don't know but they do look smooth. And they are solid wood.
What kind of condition are they in?,They are in used condition
"I see. I would like to buy them. I could give you $30 cash, and I'll pick them up wherever would be convenient for you.",$30 is fine
"Hi, is the Fusion still available?",yes it is
Does the car run good?,yes in excellent shape
"Great, been in any accidents? How many miles are on it?",no accidents 76000 miles

I can do that. I will message you shortly about a time and location to meet.,great!
HI! I'm interested in your truck. What can you tell me about it?,Everything in the Truck works okay except the AC that just sttopped working and it is not something expensive to fix. Its jut to top up the Gas
"I see. That would be out of pocket for me, but I guess I can work with it Since the truck is 15 years old, would you be willing to take $10000 for it?",If you will come pick the Truck up yourself i can consider that
That sounds great! I can make a cash offer of $10000 and pick it up today.,Oh great. Deal then
hi can you go any lower on the price of the hutch?,"hi... were just supposed to agree on a price. It said it was new for 1200, now its used for 3 months. Id say its worth 600?"

I can pay $180 to pick it up today or $215 next week.,ill take 180 today.
great.,thank you.
I'll pick up the item myself if I can have it for $28,I can give it to you for $35 and I will throw in a wood polisher

"Hey, I'd like to buy this car but I want to talk you down a bit. How many miles are on the car?","I only put 12,000 miles on the car. It's in near perfect condition."
"Oh, that's not bad. KBB has this car @ $17,000 trade in - I'll give you 19,500 right now for it","Okay, I will accept that offer. Thank you."
Hey there!,"Hello, I see you are interested in my home for rent, correct? I am looking for $2395.00 per month. How does this work for you?"
"Not quite. I'd love to buy it, I really need a place. But I can only afford $2000, would that work? I still have to pay for movers and everything, so I really need to save some cash here.","I could perhaps give a little wiggle room in this price, If youre signing the 12 month lease, I could do say $2200?"
"What is this 379 crap? Obviously, you want to negotiate. Look I'm cute, so you will give me it for free.",Hmm.. I don't know if I believe you.  I'll give it to you for 498
"OMG, trust me I'm biracial asian, very cute, KAWAII!","Sorry but I'm pretty racist, now it's 800"
"No your not, you just want to be a jerk. OMG, fine 269","Hmm, you strike a hard bargain... but yeah sure"
Hi! I am interested in the bike. Is it in good condition?,Hi there. Yes its in a good condition
Is it original?,yes it is
"Hello there, I am very interested in your bike. I have not been riding for a long time and since I am going on a long vacation I would love a bike to take with me so that I could start back biking. Would you be willing to lower your price a bit to $1155","This would be a great bike to take on vacation with you! I really wouldn't like to go much less than $1500 though because I've put a lot of money into extras (the crank, brakes, and wheels alone were $900)."
The highest I can go is $1250 considering I have to purchase pedals for it as well.,I have a pair of peddles from another bike that I'll throw in if you'll come up to $1400.
$1300 and I will pick it up right now.,Meet me in the middle at $1350 and you've got yourself an amazing bike at an amazing price!
That's a great bike you have there. Are you the original owner?,yes. I've had it for 3 decades. This is the real deal. I'm just getting too old for it.it won't last at price just because it's a vintage. make an offer i can't refuse
"Well since it's a collectible, how about $400 for it. It seems to have to wear so I'll have to put some money into it.","man, you have to do better than that. there is no way i can let go of this gem for 400. even at 999 it's a steal. at the lowest i can do 900."
That's way too much for me. It's not like it's fit for a museum or anything. How about $500?,a 37 year olf BMX bike IS fit for a museum. You're buying a part of history. not some junk bike. This is a schwinn i remind you. I really can't do lower than 900
I really don't have that much money. You have to help me out here. I can scrape together $650 but that's it.,"then really, this is NOT the bike for you. You can get a much modern bike for half that price and you will be happier. thi sis a part of BMX history. no deal."
"Hi, I am interested in a phone, are they brand new or used?","It's brand new, I didn't need them. They're $650 each, this is a steal especially since it's $150 off."
I am a student and would want to work on the price.. is that an option?,"I don't know about that. Do you have a family member or friend who might want one, the price goes down in multiples."
I could maybe get my sister in on a deal but it would have to be a great deal.,They would get knocked down to $600 each. I could also include two cases and glass screen protectors.
"Wow, still too high, i was thinking, 380 each.","I can't go that low, the lowest I could go is $575. That's only if you buy 2."
"I just think this is out of my reach, price wise. I could do 415 tops each.","No, you're going to have to come up to $525 flat and buy 4."
Is this Ling the Ding?,"I don't go by Ding. Now, if you want to get down to business, stop playing around. What's your monthly income?"
"Who are you the IRS? I make about $4000 a month, my family makes about $8000 monthly.","I'm a landlord. I need to know your monthly income. You barely meet my minimum requirements. If you can pay 2550 a month, I'll give you the place, but no more damn funny business alright. I don't like renting to wise guys. Don't be a wise guy alright? I like straight shooters. Straight arrows. Okay? You get that? Am I coming in clear?"
Straight in California what a hoot. What applications are pre-installed?,"state of the art open kitchen with stainless steel appliances, alright? i'm offering you 2550 a month buddy. take it over leave it."
Hello. I am doing well. I came across your mattress listing and I was wondering if you knew how old it is?,Yes.  It is just a few yrs old.  Just selling b/c I am getting another bed!
I see. I am in the market for a new mattress. Are you considering any lower offers at all?,I could do $230 if you could come and get.  Must be able to move down stairs.
I can arrange that. So $230 is an acceptable price?,Yes!
I am I quiring about the mercedes. How long have you had it. How many miles,I bought it new; I'm the only owner. Less than 17000 miles on it.
Has it been in any accidents. Are you willing to negotiate price,"No accidents, perfect condition, fully loaded. I'm asking $26800 which is already less than the Blue Book price, but I'd like to sell it soon so I can negotiate a little. I'd take $24000 to sell it this week."
"I am, is it still available?",yes it is and its brand new. what kind of iphone do you have?
"I have a 6, do these cases hold up pretty good?",yes they do..the one I use is going on 3 years now. have you ever used one?
"I haven't used a case like this before but been wanting to try one out. I see it's listed for $8, any way you would take $7?",I really would like to sell it for $8 because its brand new

I understand. I was looking to pay something more like $27 for the phone. Would that work for you?,"That's far too low for me, unfortunately--I'm sure I can get a better offer. I'd be willing to do 48$ and throw in a case though."

"They are lovely desks, I did notice there is some bowing along the top of them in the photos however, Would you be willing to go lower? I could come pick them up for $12 right now.",There is some slight wear and tear on the desks and cabinets. $12 is a little too low of an offer. I could agree on $18.
"Settle on 15 and ill come today, and haul them out myself.",You have yourself a deal.
i have 1500 will you take it,Can you go a little higher? It's a really nice home.

"From what I've read, It sounds like what I've been looking for! However, I've been to a few others, and the price is a little high for the area.","The price is a little bit higher than other places in the area, but this apartment has some things most others don't.  10 feet high ceilings, ceramic tile floors, two skylights and even an off street parking spot.  You know how hard those are to find here.  The deposit is 1,500 firm, but I do have a little bit of wiggle room on the price.  Around what price are you looking for?"
"My budget is around $2600 a month, would that work for you?","How about we meet in the middle.  How does 2,775 sound?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."
hi im intrested in this bike are u willing to,I've got a little wiggle room but $375 is a pretty great deal considering the work that's gone into it.
yeah i hear u but im kind of on a buget and i can offer 225,"That's a bit low for me, but I would accept $275. That's my bottom dollar. Would that work for you?"

"All of the electronics are in working order, correct?","Yes, everything has been checked out recently."
"Great! Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.",I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.
"13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500","Alright, I think that`s reasonable. We can agree on 12,500 then."
"I would like to pay only $112 for it because it is used. What do you think, is that good?","Its a Black Glass and Wood Trim 42 inch Bell'O TV stand. It's 23 inches tall and 21 1/2 inches deep.

Can you do 60?,$71.  Final offer
"That's higher than your previous offer.   Traditionally, you're supposed to go lower and I'm supposed to go higher.   I think we can meet ion the middle at 65 and get this over with.","I can find a better deal elsewhere, however, thus the higher price."
Hi is the iphone holder still avaiable?,Yes! Are you interested in buying it?

"Okay, well if it's such a great car, why are you trying to sell it?",I needed a larger vehicle for my family.
"Well, I suppose I could take it off your hands then. I'd like to pay $7350.","That price is a bit too low for me. I think $10,000 would be a fair price."
"I couldn't do $10,000. I'd be willing to drive to you and pick up the car, and I'd offer $8600.",Hmm. I can maybe do $9000.
"Okay, I'll pick up the vehicle, for $9,000.",You have a deal!

when did you purchase this,"I have only had the phone for about 5 months. Still in flawless shaped. No screen cracks, no wear on the phone. Been in a case the entire time I have owned it."

"i could come up to 235  i think that fair  and i will pick it up,,cash","Nah, I gave over 300 for it 5 months ago. I need to get 250 from it, that is literally my bottom dollar."
240..i have to spend money for gas to pick it up,"Ok, just to get it done, thats a deal."
Hi I am great!  I would like to offer $55 for the Camcorder,Only $55?  Does it not have all the features you want?
Since it is just a bit better than my standard phone I don't know if I would actually use it to justify paying the full asking price.,Ah but it comes in mint condition still wrapped inside the box.  Surely you can do $100
Since it is in mint condition I could do $70 if that is possible for you.  I could pay cash today and pick up in a few hour.,Well... if you can pick it up today and pay in cash... $75?

Yes. deal,okay great

"Oh really?  I see.  I don't mind that, but how much TLC","Well I would maybe just wipe it down, put a cushion, and treat the wood with a protector"
"Hmm.  I see. That's fine, $9 fine?",I was thinking more like 11

The image is a little dark. Is it ivory or is it white? It says you have had it in the box since you bought it. Are there any scratches on the face though?,"It's white. Nope, not a single scratch, it's just like new. It's been in the otterbox case for the entire time. I also just bought new headphones and wall charger for it."

I'll take the bike for $2,000 and I'll promise not to report you to the police.","You are too funny. Yes a very similar bike was stolen, but that is not this one. That was my wife's bike."
Best I can do,I'll throw in the 1000 watt amp with it for 275 total
200 it is,I'll do 220 for the subs or 275 for both
"Ok, 275",Can you enter a new offer? Or is the $200 stuck there?
200 is my final,"Alright, I'll take 200 for the subs. But now you're robbing me"
HI is this still availabel,Hello I am asking 4900 for the vehicle are you interested and do you have any of the questions for me?
Are you the original owner?,Yes I am and there is a clean title.  This thing rides so good it's a great little cruiser and hot rod.  There are a couple small blems in the sheet metal but other than that everything is perfect!
How about the paint how is it?,"The paint is beautiful and if you're willing to pay close to my asking price then I can offer a coupon from my friend who runs a local paint shop and you will be able to change the color if you would like to, how does that sound?"
Well Im not sure on paying that much for a 43 year old vehicle. I am sure 61k is not original I am sure from my expertise on cars that is rolled over so that makes the value drop. I can offer $2450 and come now to get it,I'm not sure if that will be approved but we can give it a shot unless you're willing to increase your offer a bit?  Perhaps you could meet me 3000 which is still almost 2k off and I can change the oils and other liquids for you too?
Great. I am interesting but can't quite manage the asking price. I was hoping 160 would be acceptable.,"I am sorry I meant 64 gigs with everything you need to get started I want to give you that rate but understand this phone is more than just 320 original, I can let it go for 300"
I understand. We're moving the right direction. I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Maybe 175 cash would be better?,iPhone 6 has so many capabilities and the picture quality is supurb. I can do 290.
It's a quality phone without a doubt but that's still a little rich for my blood. If I could get it for 192 that would make me happy. I have cash and can pick it up tonight.,"I knock off 50 dollars so that would be $270 I take it too and even gift wrap it for you. Again this is savings altogether, because you get a very good phone at a discounted rate."
"Yes, I am interested. I'm prepared to offer you $70 for the set. I'll have to walk 12 miles since my old bike was stolen. deal?",Oh. I'm a recovering heroin addict and am just trying to make even and get my life together. Uh. 80 and I'll bring it to you?
"Can you also please bring me a sandwich? if so, deal!","Yes I will make you a sandwich in the kitchen, good deal let's get married thanks."
"Hi, I am intersted in the Prius","Hi,awesome, I'm looking to sell it to someone who'll appreciate it as much as I do. Do you have any questions for me?"
"Yes, What is the advanced package?","Really neat leather seats, perfect for winter, an auto dimming rear view mirror that comes in handy especially at night as well as an enhanced entune and JBL stereo that was my favorite feature in the car"
"Ok, when was the last time it was serviced and has it had any major issues?","Absolutely no major issues at all, no accidents (you can verify this with carfax) and I've been really good about servicing it, it just got serviced at the Toyota dealership"
Would you be willing to come down in price? How about 19500?,"19k is a little too low for this particular car but I can knock off one grand for you and do 20,900"
I've got 19700 cash!,"I've got 2 other offers giving me way more than 19700-cash payments too.I do want to sell it to you so if you bump it up, we can close this deal now"
"I really like the color so I would be willing to go 20,000.","20,000 it is. deal."

Yes i am! My brother would love it! I figured I would surprise him for his birthday!,Yes its a great thing for a boy! I am sure he will love it!
hello,Did you have any questions about the item for sale?
How much is it?,$40
It looks great. I can offer $20 for it.,Well I can't cut the price in half. It is in excellent working condition. Has a remote control and an adapter.  It is really worth far more than I'm asking for it.
How about $25?,"Sorry, like I said it is worth more than I'm asking. I've already cut it down to $40 to get rid of it quickly."
"All I can afford is $30. If you live in my area, I could arrange to meet with you to pick it up(as opposed to you mailing it.).","I kind of feel like you've been wasting my time, and starting out with such a lowball offer half price, really kind of sitting wrong with me. I can do $35 and that's as long as I can go."
"Hey, is your car still for sale?","Yes, definitely. And it is a great one. Runs perfectly. CARFAX one owner. No accidents. Bluetooth Media."
"Hmm, that sounds great!  How much do you want for it?","I would like 13,500 for it. But I am willing to negotiate on that but can't come down too much."
"Well, it says on the ad it has 100k miles on it.  It's a nice car but that's quite a bit, honestly.  And it's already 6 years old","That is the dealership maintenance package which is good up to 100,000 miles. The car only has 34,000 miles on it and is a BMW i series."
"Oh, I see I need to work on my reading comprehension.  Well, I only have 10000 right now","The Kelley Blue Book value is 16,500 so I would need at least 12,000 and I can give you a month to come up with that."
what's the frame size?,"I have an 8 month old trek bike that is 21"" multiple speed great gear set. I used it a lot for school and it got me aound until I got my new car. You like it."
do you still have the receipt?  just want to make sure it's not stolen,I got the receipt and the little package with all the warranty info as well and it is not filled out so you can still get the warranty on it.
"it looks great, 600 is a little more than i have, would you accept 500 if i pick it up today?","I like 500 dollars but I need at least 600 I was going to even ask if you can put in a little bit more like make me an offer at $700. It is a brand new bike literally like a 1 year old baby, I took care of this bike and it is good to go."
"ah sorry, the most i could come up with is 552, so unless that works, good luck on the sale",What if you can do payments we can set an arrangement and I will collect 625 in total.
"sorry i can't really do more than 552 as that's already stretching it for me, thanks anyways",Lets do 595 at least and I will meet you halfway.
What condition is the phone in and does it have a clean ESN?,It is brand new. Never used. and yes. 100% clean ESn
Well I looked up the ESN and it's actually a bad ESN. You might want to double check that. Since it's a bad ESN it's only worth like 300. Will you take 300?,Not a chance! I'm unsure where you got your data but this is a new/unused phone. ESN is perfectly OK.
How old are the tires on this bike?,I just got them new last month.
and when was the last tune up?,Also last month.
Can you provide receipts for both?,"I actually throw recipts away so I could not, deepest apologies."
Then the best I can do is $179. I'll have to get new tired anyway since this is for my wife. She's a bit bigger in the seat.,Ah makes sense. I could work with you and do 179 for you!
Hello.  Is your beautiful chair still for sale?,yes it is
I can buy with cash and pick up today.  Will you accept $37?,"sorry, while appreciate the offer for pick up and cash, that is far too low to accept for such a beautiful and quality piece of furniture"
Hello.  Is the chair still for sale?,yes it is
hello. I am interested in your car. Could you tell me a little more about it?,It's a nice reliable old Honda. It comes with a sweet Pioneer sound system.
What are the miles? And is the inspection up to date?,"It's 153k miles. As for inspection, I can't guarantee anything. It runs great though. Used cars are buy at own risk."
That's a lot of miles. I could offer you 2000,I'm also interested in trades. Do you have a vehicle?
I have a 2000 honda accrod,I'm looking for a small SUV or small pickup.
I am sorry. I have an accord and was looking for something smaller. I can offer 2000 for your car,"Given the high miles, I could possibly let it go for $3000."
That is a little out of my price range. The highest I could go is 2500.,If you have cash today I'll give it to you for $2700.
I have 2500 in cash,I think I better wait for a better offer. Sorry.

"Hello, what can you tell me about this product?","Hello, well it's not a product. It's a 4 bedroom apartment that is 2 blocks to UCB. These are modern and high end places that go for $7995. That price includes utiities."
Do you allow pets?,"Yes, we do, but there is a $250 pet deposit that would go on top of the rent."
Hey how are you?,doing well thank you !  How is your day going???
Very well! It got better when I saw your post! It all looks new and wonderful but i only have 10 bucks to spare would you take 10 if i came and got it asap?,Hmmmm.  When would you be ale to pick it up?
As  soon as you are ready!,I will do ten if you can throw a can of coors in?
Hello that is a nice chair you have listed. Is it still available?,"Hi, thank you. Yes it's still available"
Is the price negotiable? Can you come down any on the the price?,Yes the price is negotiable. I could come down a little bit on price since it's in almost new conditions.
Well new is good. I need it for my back. Since I am in front of the computer all day.,This would be a great chair for that. It's extremely comfortable. I can bring it down to $275.
Well new is good. I need it for my back. Since I am in front of the computer all day.,Ok sure. I really need it gone and would like to help someone. So yes it's yours for that price.
Yes I am. Is it new or used?,We didn't use it much before my daughter went off to college. She had her computer on it so it's pretty peerless
"Okay. How about the drawers? Do they open and close easily or do you need that ""extra push"" to deal with it?","Oh she didn't use the drawers at all, so I'm confident that you could slide them in and out nicely"
Great. The price is way too high for me. can we negotiate on that?,"Yeah, what's your budget? I can't really go lower than 45 because of the chair that's included"
"Well what if I don't want the chair, can you just give me the table for #36?","Oh, you don't want the chair? Okay, give me 40 and you have a deal"
I would like to buy your chandelier,I still have it. It's in really good condition. I'm asking 120
Would you take $100?,"100 I don't know, I've already lowered the price so it could sell faster because I need the money for remodeling. It's worth a lot more than 120"
You could sell today $100 cash,"No that's not enough, how about I go down to 110?"
Meet in the middle 05 and I can pick up in an hour,"Okay that's fair, cool."
"Hi, I really love your table. Does it come with chairs?","No chairs are included. But the solid oak table is very nice and will pair nicely with many different styles of kitchen chairs or bar stools. It's got great character, with only minor scratches. Really sturdy product, that's why I'm asking for $95."
How long have you had it?,"For a while, It's very old. But like I said, still very sturdy, well made, and only has minor scratches."
"Since there are minor scratches, would you consider taking 75?",Okay we can do that. Would you be willing to pick it up? I can't really deliver it with my current vehicle.
"I'm great, are you still selling the pack of electronics?","I am it's quite a little collection/  I am moving soon, and just do not have the time to separate it all."
what condition is everything in?,"All of these are brand new, so you are getting good quality if you like them.  I am charging only $5 today. I need to get packing on other things."
"Since you're so busy, I wouldn't mind coming to pick up the items myself if you drop the price to $4.","Ok, that sounds like a deal. Can you come no later than 5pm?"
hello there,"Hi, are you interested in purchasing the dining set?"
yes i am how much would you sell it for?,"I would like 400. You get the table with two leaves, six chairs, a china cabinet and a buffet/hutch, so a huge set. It's in excellent shape, so it's a steal. You can't get this much furniture at a store for a fraction of this cost."
how about 360?,"Well, meet me at 380 and we deliver. Sound good?"
sounds nice to me,"Great, it's a deal then!"
Hello. Do you still have the kid's bike?,"Yes, we are asking $20 for it."
"I see that. Unfortunately, I'm a little short on cash. Can I give you $10?","Yes, if you can come pick it up?"
Do you know if a 3 year old could ride it?,"Yes, it is a small bike.  My 2 and 4 year old rode it."
I'm not sure if it will fit in my trunk. I have a honda accord. Can you bring it over?,It fits in my Geo Metro.  It shouldn't have any trouble fitting in the Honda.
Hello!! I see that you have a queen size bedroonm set for sale,I do! It's only going for $480 too!
Awesome!! I see that your dresser's has some problems ( the mirror came off) and now it's stained is that correct?,"This is true, however I spent close to $1000 on it and took the stain and mirror into consideration. If it helps I can go to $440?"
I am interested in yoru bedroom set but I was thinking of making you another offer I can pick it up tonight if your available,I can take a little more off if you're willing to come pick it up. What is your offer?
I can pay you $432 cash,You got a deal!
"Hello, I'mm interested in learning more about the apartment near Montclaieew (2 BR/1 Bath, 1 LR and balcony). I don't see a balcony in the image. Do you have more images?",I do not - sorry

Loing term tenant with lease?,Yes. They left

"No pets, no children, and I do not smoke.",1950 a month and you got yourself a deal.
Can we meet right now?,Yes.
"Hi, I am very interested in this placve",The apartment is in mint condition in a fabulous location. Are you interested I purchasing or a long term rental?
"Hi, I am very interested in this placve","yes. I see that you're interested. Re you looking to purchase or a long term rental? And which size are you interested on, 2 or 1 bedroom layout?"
"I am most interested in the studio size, I wish it was total electric rather than gas. But, I understand that is how the apartment comes.",the studios are lovely. Are you interested in buying or renting?
I am interested in buying but I need some movement on the pric,"yes, that is true. But gas is preferred by most cooks, so that's how the apartments were configured. I'm sure it would be an easy conversion should you choose to do that. I'm sure we can meet at a reasonable price."
"Really interested in the Tacoma. Has it been in any accidents or any dents, scratches to be aware of?","It has never been in any accidents, and is in perfect condition. It is clean inside and out, runs perfect."
What color is the interior. Is it leather or fabric? Does it have any navigation system and does it have an jack for mp3?,"It is leather interior, has a navigation system, and an mp3 jack."
What color is the interior?,The interior is Black.
Great. Could you let it go for $10350?,I could go $10800 but no lower. Can you handle that?
Deal. Can you meet me halfway? I'm 200 miles away.,"Sure, we can meet halfway. That's a deal."
Yes I really like it. How many miles are on it?,"80,000, but it's a really rugged vehicle and it can go a lot longer before it starts to have problems with the engine or transmission."
"it looks like a great find. just what I am looking for. i don't mean to be cheap but my budget is around 11,000","I understand. I don't think I can let it go for $11,000 though. I'm sure we an strike a bargain so you can afford it. Can you come up on the price?"
"Sure I would be willing to go as high at 13,500",Could yo do that up front and pay the rest over a year?
I could pay $6000 up front and the rest in installments,"I could take the offered $13,000 as the initial. I can't risk installments for $16,000."
ok I understand then my final offer will be $13000 all cash up front,"For an all cash offer the best I can do it $4,000 less than asking."
"ok my best and final offer is 16,000",Deal
"Yes, I can see that!  Are all the parts original Schwinn?",Yes they are! They're in great condition too.
No rust?,No rust at all. It rides really smoothly and I've never had a problem with rusting in the 10 years I've owned the cruiser
What about the chain.  Has it ever been replaced or is it the original chain,"No, it's the original!"
I'm asking because we don't have a Schwinn store in the area and I hate to order parts online.,"The original makes it more vintage and classic, to be honest. Also, apologies-- I actually forgot to tell you the tires are new and they're Kendra, not Schwinn. But you'd want new tires anyways since new tires are what keep the cruiser riding smoothly. You wouldn't want tires from the 60s."
"Lol It was a good time, but yeah, you're right.  Ok, so what's the rock bottom price you would accept for this beauty?",I'd be willing to sell for $200.
Ouch!!  My budget is very tight and I want this bike soooooooo bad.  Would you be willing to accept 190?,Sure. $190 is fine.
I can make a deposit of 500.00 to hold the car,"There is no way I could go that low. I would take 4,500."
"Hello, I'm interested in buying the Samsung S3 Classic","She's a beauty, in flawless condition."
It's very nice. Would you be willing to bring the price down to $253?,Absolutely! Send that though and I'll accept it. Good doing business with out partner.
"Hi, is the Jaguar still available?","Yes, I still have it"
"Hi, is the Jaguar still available?","Yes, it sure does. That's the only negative though, it's a great car. No issues at all, everything works reliably."
That's good. No picture. I would like to offer $2250.,"Sorry, that's a bit too low. Everything works, including a security system, pioneer system, bluetooth and auxiliary. I can take $3000."
"Wow, the ad doesn't mention all that. Okay, I can go to $2650.","It's also very clean inside, with leather seats and decent paint. Everything automatic. I can meet you halfway at $2850."
I think you have yourself a deal. $2850.,Great!
Im interested in the 4bedroom in Pleasanton. Is the neighborhood safe?,very safe and very good school district too. Do you have kids?
Yes I do. That is a great plus. Is it carpet or hardwood? does it have a backyard?,"Just installed new carpet all through and yes, it does have a backyard. not too big though so you dont have to worry about a whole lot of mowing! The neighbors are very nice too"
That sounds great! Unfortunately the price is high for me. The offer i can give you is $1675,Unfortunately that's very low for this much space and this neighborhood. The typical rent in this particular area for a similar property is about 3400
Finances are very tight right now. The most I can do would probably be $2500,"I understand finances are tight everywhere, I do but that's below fair market value. I can however do 2800"
"I like the bike, but it is 37 years old. Is there some wiggle room on the price?","I know the age seems to be a factor but it is an original, I have taking care of this bike for many years and it is great for anyone who enjoys bike riding. I can listen to a few offers but be reasonable please."
I could go $675,Your paying for a piece of history can you at least do $975.
I could go $725 if you could deliver it/Ship it,well that is gonna cost me some money to deliver it to you. This bike has tradition and has all the original decals are still on it. It has new tubes and I even throw in a warranty.
"I can do $850, it's literally all i have for this purchase.","I can do at least $933 and give you the warranty, deliver it and even throw in an extra tire with rim."
"Hello I am interested in this table, is it in good condition?","Yes, It is a good quality table. It's been sanded down so you could paint it if you want"
Ok I see. Do you accept only cash?,Cash or a check would work
"Nice, is there any chance you can make me a better price, around 60$, and I can pick it up by myself",If you can pick it up I'd be willing to lower the price a bit to 75.
Are you sure the leafs seams can be tigher? I will agree on 75 if yes,"Yes, they close tighter if you have someone on the other end to help you push it closed."
This is a nice bike. Why are you getting rid of it?,Hi there!
Excellent! I was looking for this bike in a different color. This color will be fine. Highest I can go is 15.,"Okay I can do $15, but you'll have to stop by my place and pick it up. I hope that's fine with you. I can't really deliver it right now."
Yes that is fine. I'll come by shortly,Thanks a lot! See you then.
That's a cool bike!,Thanks! It's a classic. There aren't that many around anymore which makes it a collectible! Are you interested in buying it.
"Yeah, but I don't know if I can afford $200 for it.",Throw me an offer and we'll meet half way
I could probably do $75,That's a little low. How about 150 and I can bring it to you.
"How about $125, and I can pick it up?",135$ and we've got a deal!
"Hi, I am interested in your speakers advertised for sale. What is the condition? Have you used them a lot? Do they work? Are you the original purchaser?",Hello. The condition is good. They haven't been used alot but I have used them and they work good. Yes I am the original purchaser.
"I would love to buy them from you. Being as there is no picture, would you take $40 and I pick them up?",I would be willing to discount them to $55 if you would be willing to pick them up.
Could we split the difference and do $50? I can still pick up,"Yes, I would be willing to take them for $20."
I like your Mazda 3 car.,"Cool, did you have any questions about the car?"
"Yes, has it been in any major accidents or had any major failures of the engine etc?",No major accidents or failures of any of the systems. It's in great shape. It's got a lot of upgrades and it's in really good shape. It runs snooth and quiet and is very reliable.
How does $13050 sound?,"It's allmost new with only 23556 miles on it and it's only a year old. How about going up to 13,500?"
Yes I am!  Is anything wrong with it?,Hi are you interested in the coffee maker?
"Yes, I am interested. What are the measurements of the trunk?","39"" long 25"" wide and 19"" tall"
"good, how are you",Very well. You are interestd in the Armoire?
"yes, is the picture of the same armoire or just a similar one","It's the same one, i just took the unpacked photo off HSN's website."
"gotcha, would you be able to ship it to me?","Unfortunately i cannot, that's why i have it local pick up only."
"sorry, i don't see that note in your listing","It's in the last sentence. I was paralyzed in an auto accident so i can no longer drive to the post office, etc."
"it must have been cut off of the listing i'm looking at.  Since i have to come pick it up, can you work with me on the price a little bit?  How about $55.",I can do $55. It would have to be cash tho.
Is this a bot?      I have done this task 3 times now????,"No, I have seen this one twice as well."
hi,"Hi, I understand you are interested in this awesome rental property. What questions do you have for me?"
"Hello, sorry for the delay i  am",Do you have any questions about it?
"Yes , I am on a budget, and there is no rear brake cable, and it needs a new chain, the orignal seat means it is going to be worn, can you come down on price because of all the work it needs? How about 35?",I had it priced low at $90 because of the missing cable and worn chain. I can't do $35. Since you're on a budget how does $80 sound and i'll bring it to you?
"How about you bring it to me, and I trade in my 19"" Bmx bike that is in about the same shape but not as nice, and we settle on $45?",I was looking to trade for a mountain/road bike. How about $60 with the trade and i'll still deliver?
Can you include any sort of warranty? If so I can do that pric.,Yea if after a week you don't like it we can do a refund.
Hello! I am interested in buying this phone cover.,Alright! Is there anything you would like to know?
It looks like the right fit but I would rather pay only $2. I can come pick it up.,How does $3 sound if I throw in a chrager?
"Hello, Is the etagere still for sale?",yes
"Considering the pictures didn't work and I'm not able to see it before purchase, I'm going to have to ask for quite a bit lower price. Can you do $20?",how about 25
Sure.,I will need your phone number
"Hello, I am interested but the price seems extremely high for this neighborhood and only 1 bedroom I would be willing to pay $850","What? It's Berkely. California is expensive, especially this area. I'm willing to do $1600. If you notice we are very selective and don't allow section 8. Your neighbors are upstanding people."
"The same size units are going for around $900, that is what I would offer you.","No, you need to meet me int he middle at $1250."
"I cannot go higher than 1,115. That is more than fair when you look at the comps","Ok, but can you do first, last, and security deposit at once?"
"Well hello there, how are you doing?","Im doing great, just bought a new Jeep and my wife wants me to part ways with my baby."
"Oh that sucks, well you can look at it this way.  Now you may be able to pass it on to me and I will love it as you did.  Can you tell me about your favorites?",I love the smooth transmission in this car the tip-tronic works well and even though the motor is on the small side the car produces great power on the low end and it only has 80 k
"Nice that sounds great, I see that you're asking 4900 which is a little high for me and I was actually hoping to find a good car for like 2250.  I see that this is way off, but maybe we can work something out?","For a Mercedes with this low amount of miles and no issues you would be out of luck, the lowest id go for anyone is 4000 and that is my highest offer. mind you this car was garage kept. I guarantee you wont run into issues for at least a solid 30k"
Oh I see and understand.  Well I appreciate you dropping 900 off of it for me and I can accept that.  Maybe I can take you out for drinks sometime too!,"i'll throw in some free maintenance also, you seem like a cool guy and I want to make sure she stays fit."

ok can you go 46 or is 50 final offer,How about 49 and Ill deliver?
nice bike you got there,"Hi there!  I really need the cash for this bike.  I can offer to sell for $185.  This was a $400 bike new, so it is a great deal.  You interested?"
185 is still pretty high for me. especially for a used bike. i can go... 140 tops,"If you can pay $155, I will throw in a bike chain, lock, and helmet.  Deal?"
"you know what? that is a deal. 155 it is for the bike, chain, lock and a helmet","Perfect, thanks!"
I will buy it for 152 dollars,It has only been used two times and has the instruction manual and DVD. I would need more than that.
i think it is a good deal,How about $180
no way no way I can agree for 160,How about we split the difference and do $170.
No sorry it is too much,Make me a different offer then.
174,174? I could do that.
sorry I typed 174 instead of 164,$165 and you have a deal

The property is situated on a woodsy lot with a private driveway in a very quiet neighborhood behind a large house.  I'm asking $3,200 with the signing of a 1 year lease."
"I am truly interested in this home, but $3200 is a bit high for me right now as I am just moving in from out of state.  Would you consider $3000?",well I guess we can do $3000
um we have to negotiate the price.,I had trouble finding the text box.
you found it. now i'll tell you what. i'll sign a 6 mo lease if you let me have it for say... 2250. what do you say?,"Well that is way below asking price. This includes all utilities, gas, water, trash. And there is even a den that could be used as a third room"
"ok. how's this. i'll sign a one year lease, and we go with 2500 even","I already submitted the final agreement which was 2750, and I can only enter the offer once."
Thanks,What would you like to pay for this?
1719,"$1,719?"
I think there is a problem. I finished a negotiation with someone else for an apartment and accepted the offer already.,"Oh. ok. I just started this negotiation. Can you help me finish it? If you meet my list price, I'll deliver it to you for free."
What am I negotiating for?,"I'm selling a teak, modern Danish mid-century table, perfect for a coffee table or end table. I'm asking $95."

I will agree to the $95 price,Great! Thanks. It's on its way to you.
It's not working. I wrote to the requestor.,"Ah, bummer. Alright... I guess we should quit?"
Unfortunately so. You can contact the requestor as well. Sorry.,That's ok. thanks for your help.
I'm interested in the leather case.,Sure. Do you have any questions about it?

Black,Sure will be delivered to you right away thanks for choosing me!

"Yes, but my budget's limited",Okay well make me an offer I'll see what I can do.

"I can come pick it up, but with gas, etc... it would be pushing the envelope to make it worth my while....I was looking to spend a max of $20....must be an heirloom this credenza, eh?",Yes it's a pretty rare piece too. I can do 25 if that helps you but that's going to be my limit.
"Definitely feel for you there on the family legacy item.  Listen, if you'll go $23.50, I'll come up myself, get it off your hands, and get you a beer...",Okay and you move it by yourself too then we have a deal at 23

I'm afraid I really would looking at around 20 dollars not to insult you but it is used.,"I only had it for six months and I barley set in it because it stayed in a room that I was going to use for an office, but decided not to. $20 is too low. I give it to you for $30"

What is the deposit?,if you move in now no deposit
"So no deposit, and I get a month free?",2250 without a dep thats right

Hi! I am interested in the wing back chair. I would like to offer $20.,"What are you insane? My boyfriend is so gay, we never even used this thing, he bought it and treated it like a grandmother."
That explains the pattern of the chair. I am going to have to pay to get it re-upholstered so I am taking that cost into account. $30 is about the most I can offer taking that into account.,"Baby, you don't neeeeeeeed to re-upholster this chair, but you want too. Which I admire. I have it listed for $50, but the only way you are going to get it for $30 is taking me on a date, which he won't care. So, just give me the $10 now for the date, cause I'm a pill and a half. $40"
I'm quite sure he won't. I can't go over $35.,"That's not even an amount you can get out of the ATM, what is that liquor store money. $40 baby, $40, this thing hasn't even been sat on. It's a ""collectable custom"" chair, HA! Re-uphoster it twice, I don't care. $40"
I am interested in your typewriter,"Ok, well it is great condition. Do you have any questions?"
does it still type well? I know its vintage but I am a collector of these types of things.,"Yes, I used it recently to make sure. It works great, good as new. I can give it to you for $55"
I would really love it but can only afford at the most $45,How about $50?
sure $50 will work,Ok excellent. You know where to meet to pick it up right?
Nice bike. I'm very interested. Cash in hand. My offer is 1100 and I can pick up ASAP.,I would love to sale ASAP but the lowest I could go would be $1500 since it is in excellent condition and has been very well taken care of. It is all carbon and even has a carbon wheelset and is lightweight but durable.
In all honest my all in price is 1200 and that's right down to my last dollar.,If you pick up today I can go as low as $1300 and throw in extra pedals and seat cushion.
I suppose I could borrow the extra. I'll be there and have $1300 agree?,Great. We have a deal
"Hello, I am doing great. How are you? I am interested in the apartment on Bassett Dr. Is it still available?",Yes it sure it.
Has it been remodeled recently? Is it close to shops?,"Yes we actually just remodeled it this past month so everything is brand new.  The location is perfect, it is a quiet residential neighboorhood but you are just a 5 minute walk from many local shops."
Would you be willing to come down on the price at all? Would you take $800?,I can come down a bit on the price but there is no way that i can cut it in half.  What I can do is reduce the rent by 200 if you are wiling to sign a 2 year lease.
I see it's a 10 unit apartment. Would you be willing to come down on the price more if I can offer to do maintenance for the rest of the units?,Well that is a possibility.  What are your qualifications?
"I have 10+ years of experience in building maintenance, carpentry and electrical work. I also have references.",Ok that sounds good.  These apartments do not need much so I can reduce the rent another 300 making it $1095.  Of course if there are months that we need you to do more work then we can discuss further reduction at that time.
Hello,Hey there are you interested in the chairs?
I am. Are they in good shape?,"They are great chairs, the wife just wants different ones for the new house."
Cool. Can I come by and take a look at them?,Sure if you would like.
Will you lower the price for me?,"If you pick up I will drop it too $100 and if I deliver, I will drop to $125.00"
I would like to pick it up if you do not mind,Not a problem I will email you my address. $100 and they are yours.
will you take $20. thats an old phone thats out of shape,It's actually still in good condition and is a touch screen smart phone.
yeah all phones are touch screen smart phones now,Not all phones will still work as good as this one.
Most will probably work better,I wouldn't agree. The screen is not damaged and I think I have it listed at a very fair price. I would be surprised to see another like this for a lower amount.
HI!  I've very interested in the bike you have for sale!,"Thats great, it is in excellent condition"
I know it says near mint condition!  So are there any scratches on it or dents?,No scratches or dents.  It looks practically brand new
Sounds like just the bike I've been looking for.  Would you take $99 for it?,yes that will be fine
"I noticed your ad for the batteries. I need one for my phone, since the battery on my phone is starting to go. I really only needed one battery, but you are the only listing I've seen so far. Could you consider $6?",They're basically a set since I have no use for them. They both work great. I can negotiate but $6 is a bit low... I could go $7 and throw in the charger because I don't need that anymore either.
"Okay, that will work for me.","Okay great, could you pick them up today?"
Sure,Ok sounds like a deal.
"Yes, it's compatible with my Air 2.",Did you look at all of the features and the keyboard.
"Yes, and I do like it. But, I'm worried about how it will stand up over time.",I can assure you the case is very durable and can handle the normal iPad user.
How did that label fall off?,My child was playing with it and I did not realize until it was too late.
"Okay, well, I like it. I was hoping to get it for $10, but since it looks nice and has the keyboard, I would go $15.",I think thats a reasonable offer and I accept.
Sank I m  fine,So what are you looking for? and how can I help you with the product>
Hello. I am looking for a new apartment. Are you able to tell me if the majority of the apartments in this building are students' homes?,Yes it is and the great news is it is not far from the campus five minutes or less to get there!

Hi I am looking for a good bike for my wife.,"This is the bike for you! Its the bike I've had for 2 years and its honestly in better condition now than the day I bought it! the tires are new and it has 21 speeds! Only taking cash, $80 is the listing price."
"I should be able to get all the cash together but was hoping to pay closer to 60, if I am able to come and pick it today would you be willing to do that price?","Yes of course! That helps me out a bunch, as I don't have a way to deliver it to you. I'll see you later today then!"
The apartment is gorgeous. How is the neighborhood?,The neighborhood is great.
Is there a pool at the complex?,"There is a pool, hot tub, exercise room and and outside basketball court."
Awesome. 2300 is a bit steep for me. How about $1800?,"Well, I could lower the price some.  I was thinking about $2100.  You should come by and take a look.  We are generally available from 8:30 to 1.  I could show it to you in the evening as well."
I guess I can swing $2100. I'll check it out.,Sounds good.  When would you like to come?
I would really like this but it is too much money for me. I am looking more towards the price range of 1000,"1000 is very low, how about 1700?"
I can't afford that right now. Could you go down more if I don't need help moving in?,I'm not allowed to go any farther down than 1600
I'm just not sure if I can do that. There is no way you are allowed to go lower?,No

"Does it have a Refrigerator, dishwasher, stove/oven, microwave?","I will have to ask the owner I am just the sales man. Regardless the house is going fast! I can offer you rent for 2695 a month. Hold on, the owner just told me that the place has been newly renovated and has all of those features!"
I was in a wreck a few years ago and have limited income. I can afford $2200 a month,Ok that is fine with me! I appreciate the honesty!
I am good and how are you?,"Well, thank you. I have a gorgeous Fender Amp for sale, are you interested?"
Yes very much so what condition is it in?,"Excellent condition, with a little rust on the metal corners."
"Ok i am more than willing to come pick it up but i only have 40 dollars to spare at the moment, will you accept that?","I sure will, that sounds great. Thsanks for doing business."
"Hello, do you still have your 3 piece leather sofa set?","hi, yes i certainly have! it's at 1000 but i can do at 950 for a quick deal"
they look amazing and would be perfect for my new apartment. but right now I can only do $900.,well it's virtually brand new! still has tags on! let me think for a sec..

i will offer you 1500,that is way too low. please make a more reasonable offer
how about 1750,i can't go much lower than 3000. that would be way below market for a place like this
what if i agree to pay for utilities,"if you pick up the utilities, I could go to $2900"
that's still too high for me. what if I agree to furnish the place myself?,i'm afraid I absolutely can not go any lower than 2850
"my budget is 1500, but i'd be willing to go 2250 max",that's just too low. i can't accept that
"how about we meet in the middle, 2500? that's my final offer","no thank you, you will just have to find another place"
love this van,Thanks how much are you willing to pay
can you tell me some features and how many miles,"The millage is stated at 109,960 miles with no accident history"
i can go for $8550,"Great Price but i need to you to step up a little to about $8,900 so i can have it delivered to you by myself"
"Hi, I am very interested. How is the condition of the bike","It is in great condition as an art piece. It has great patina, all the original decals are still on it, nice chain ring horse. Hard to find these in this condition any more."
"I like it a lot, are you willing to come down on price?","If you're able to pick it up right away and pay cash I could definitely come down a bit on the price. But like I said this is a rare find, so I can't really let it go too low."
"I have $140, and can come right now",That's a bit on the low side for this piece. I could do $160 though.
How about 155?,Sure that sounds good

Tires and brakes are in great condition and is very light to ride.  I have had no trouble with it at all.  Just looking to get a newer one!  I am throwing in a free speedometer and bottle holder too.
"That sounds like a great deal, but I don't have the 225$ you're asking. Would you be willing to go down to 175$ if I picked it up from you today with cash in hand?",$175 is too low. I could do $190.  It is in excellent shape and needs nothing at all.
Hi are you still selling the spider?,Yes it's still here for sale.
What condition is it in is there anything wrong with it?,"It's in mint condition actually, nothing wrong at all. No scratches, no dings, everything is perfect."
That's good. Are you flexible on the price?,I can work with you on the price but no low ball offers.
"Would you take $2,000 for it?","No that's too low, remember this is in mint condition, perfect condition and it has only 150 miles on it."
"Okay will you take $2,500?",2600 if you come and pick it up.
Yes the table looks like exactly what I'm looking for! what can you tell me about it condition and price wise?,Sure thing! The table is in excellent condition. No scratches or cracks.

Alright you got yourself a deal! I can stop by later on today and pick it up. $30 it is!,Sounds good!
Hi I am interested in your honda civic for sale.,"great, it's an awesome car that has been upgraded with enhanced intake and exhaust"
"I see that it is a salvaged title.  Because of this, and my extraordinarly tight budget this month, I'd like to make an offer of $2500 in cash, today.","sorry, we're not going to be close to a deal at that price.  the car only has 30k miles.  i'd be willing to sell at $4k, factoring in the title."
"Seeing as it is salvaged, it will cost me more in to insure.  I think that I could go up to $2800.",my insurance company did not increase my rates because of the title.  I can give you my agent's phone # and you can work with him too.

"Wow, in that case I would have to have a lower price to take it off your hands.  $20?","Are you kidding me? It was signed by Risky Business Tom Cruise, not Couch Jumping Tom Cruise. I'm pretty sure you didn't know that just now."
"I wish it was Top Gun Tom Cruise,  or Top Gun 2 Tom cruise soon enough.  ok.  Let's do $1 for ever 1000 brush strokes.  So $31  That's a little Risky, but fair","I like the way you do Business, partner. Sounds like a deal. Thank you! giving a discount for the funny"

the most i could give would be $150 that alll the spare funds i have,Unfortunately I could not go any lower then $200. This is only a year old and in great condition.
what about 180,I would do 180 if I take out the extra accessories I was throwing in.

deal,deal and thank you for your business

"Thanks. I know the car is really old and probably has a lot of miles on it, do you think you could consider $1700?",For it's age the miles are not high.  And the car is in great shape.  Plus the Turbo really helps out with the gas. Would you consider $2800.00?
"It sounds good, but I can't afford that high. What about $1800?","Well we are $1000.00 apart in price, I am more then willing to split the difference with you.  How about $2300.  And I will insure you got a full tank of gas."
I can't afford that since my house payment is due and I have to make sure I have a place to live. $1900 is the highest I can go.,I would be more then willing to allow you to make a down payment on the car and finish paying it off in 30 days.  I will give you a receipt for your down payment.  The car will stayed in a garaged state until you pay it off. .
hello,Hello you interested in the computer?

"Ok, I can offer you $9","I can take $5 off since you're a new customer, making it cheap at $10"
"Ok, sounds like a great deal. thank you",I said $10 dollars not $9.
"Yes I realized I entered 9 on accident when you'd said 10 lol, I am sorry",Well if you promise to refer customers to me I will give you the additional $1 off
"Ok, I do have a friend that plans to come with me and schedule a repair as well. Again I am sorry about entering the wrong number",not a problem.
That's a bit high.  How well does it ride?,"It rides great, though a little too small for me which is why I no longer need it"
"Hello, I'm interested in your listing, can you tell me more about it?","It is a one bedroom apartment, centrally located in Richmond (walking distance to BART), with a full bathroom and appliances."
"That sounds nice, but it's a little too costly for me. How does $800 sound?","No, I'm sorry, but I can't go that low. I have several others interested in the unit. However, I'm authorized to give you a 20% discount, which would bring it down to $1275, if you can sign the documents in the next 48 hours."

"Hello there, I see you have a Chevy for sale?","yes I do, a 2015 chevy sonic LT hatchback"
How many miles are on it?,"It has 30,000. It was a salvage from very light damage"
I like the power locks and windows. How much are you asking for?,"Thank you, I'm asking $5995 for it"
"Kelly Blue Book puts it at $4000, I can pay that especially since it was in salvage?",I can't take $4000. I'm willing to negotiate lower than the asking price though
I can come pick it up but I can't justify paying more than $4200 for it because of the KBB value.,What about $4500?
That is the ugliest chair I have ever seen. I must have them. I am an artist. How much for all 4?,"I can do 600 each, BUT if you want all four ill cut you a deal"
"Hi there, are the bar stools still for sale?","I DO!!! I have 2 bar stools that are walnnt slat bar stools 24"" seat hieght and I am located in Vallejo.  They are mid century style slat bar stools.  I would like $65.00 for both!"
$65 is not a bad price but a little steep considering they show some wear. Would you consider lowering the price to $40 if I were to come pick them up?,If you would pick them up I will do $40
"Hi, not sure if the charger would work for my car. Can you sell it to me for $5?","It will work, i have never seen a car without a cigarette lighter port.\"
"Still, can I buy it for $5? I'm on a tight budge",I think the lowest I would want to go is 8.
How about $6 and I pick it up myself? It'll save you shipping to me.,"7, and we have a deal."
Hi I am interested in your Walnut Dresser,"Awesome!it is mid century modern, with 6 drawers, and is in great condition!"
It looks beautiful. I would love this for my bedroom,I am willing to let it go for $550.  This is a more than fair asking price.

I can offer you $495 for it,"hmmm, I can go down to $540 and throw in delivery."
Hello yes I'm interested in your privateer what year is it and what kind of condition is it in?,it's 1996 and mint condition.
Hey I like this mirror. Is it in good condition? Any knicks?,Hello
Okay sounds good. How biig is it?,27 1/2 inches wide
Decent size. I'll give you $12 for it.,"I bought it for $35 , how about 23?"
But it is used. How about $15?,17 and it's yours
Okay 17 it is. I'l  pick it up today.,Thanks! I'll be here!
"Hey! Yes, I am! I was actually looking for the gray model. This says Artic White, is that correct?",that is correct.
"Hmm... I think I could make the white work. Are you available to meet sometime this week, maybe Friday? I have $10 cash in hand, ready to go.",Very well this is just fine. And the date will work as well.
I'm interested in your bike so you still have it and what can you tell me about it?,"Yes I still have it.  It is a steel frame, so very durable.  Brand new white tires, the brakes are a bit squeaky wd-40 could probably fix that.  There are also several new parts on it.  I would like to get 160 for it"
"Hi, what kind of condition is it in?","Its in great condition considering its age. It was used, but always taken care of. I'm sad to be rid of it but I need to since I'll be travelling in the future. I'm looking to get 120 for it."
"hI, I'm interested in the POS computer",Sure. It's in great condition
How much are you asking?,I would like to get $250 for the set
Do you  have the instructions that came with it?,"You know I actually can't find the manual, but I'm sure instructions can be found online. I can, however, teach you how to use it if you come over"
"I was really hoping to spend a little less; and if you don't have the instructions, I may have to even buy a new manual; unfortunately, I cannot bring my Equipment to you, for show and tell - would you be able to take less?  Say, $100?",Oh that's a little too low. I can maybe go down to $200. Would that be acceptable?
"The add shows an asking price of $200, I almost felt ripped off when you asked for $250.  Can you meet in between at $150?",How about $175 and I'll deliver it to you? You can test it all you want in your shop before you pay me.
"Hey, what can you tell me about this Specialized bike?",It's hella high grade and expensive.
What do you think about $1000 dollars for it?,"I know the pedals aren't included, but that's really low balling it. I know it's dumb to spend 2450 bucks on a bike, that's why my wife is nagging me to get rid of it. How about $2300"
$2000 is the highest I'm willing to go. I can come pick it up from you in the next thirty minutes or at your earliest possible convenience and I can pay in full in cash,"Alright, can you take my wife too ?"
I'm great thanks for asking. I was wondering if you allowed pets?,"No, it is a no pet policy. Unless it is a gold fish."
It is a gold fish so that's good. And is there a nice backyard?,"Yes , and gardening is also included in the price."
I'd like this for 2940 if that's possible,I am looking to make a deal so I will accept that. I hope you and your goldfish find it to your satisfaction.
"Yes, but I have some questions. Is it made of real wood?","It is, and it's a little heavy when you're transporting due to that."
I think I can deal with transportation. How about $100 for it?,100 is way too low for this quality. I can go as low as 175.
yes hi I am inquiring about your fluid trainer set,Hello. Yes I am interested in selling it.
Those Pendant Lights are beautiful!,"Yes, I wish I could keep them! They are in excellent condition. Are you interested in buying them for $500?"
"Well...""Structurally Sound"" doesn't inspire much confidence for the luster of the lamps. If you polish them and deliver, I can go as high as $400.",I can certainly do that.
nice wheels. what's the mileage on this?,"87000, it's in great shape"
guess that's about average for a car that's 8 years old. you said you're interested in a trade?,"no,looking to sell for $14900"
it says possible trade right over there at the end ---->,"no, seeling only"
"I'm interested in this apartment, could you tell me a little bit more about it?","It has a great walk to UCB, laundry, year lease, and modern. $2425 is what I am asking for it. No dogs, cats allowed."
"I don't have any pets, so that's not a problem. Are any utilities included?","Yes, all utilities are included, that includes wifi and cable."
What floor is the apartment located on?,"It is on the second floor, fireplace too, nice view."
I have a bad knee and walking up stairs is difficult for me. I'd still be interested though if the price were right. Would you consider $1100 for the years lease and drop the wifi and cable? I have unlimited data on my phone and rarely watch television anyway.,"I am sorry, that is way too low for me to go. In this area , that would never happen. The lowest I can go is $2100."
"Yes, very interested. Need to know the condition ASAP",They're only lightly used in a business setting. Pretty much unmarked. will you do 90?
"hi i would like rent your place, it looks great","thank you, i really need to get someone in there.. are you able to pay the $3985 rent easily?"
yes we both work at a tech firm and do pretty well...but thats a little high..how about $2500,"ok good, but that's a little less than I need to get..how about 3k?"
thats' still a bit more than we want to spend...is there any perk you could add like cable or wifi?,"Sure, I could add the house to my internet plan no problem...so we have a deal at 3000/m including wifi?"
and cable?,"oh, yes it's AT&T so it's high speed internet and Dish Network channels"
Hello. Yes I am. Whats so special about yours?,"Well, the easier question to answer would be what's not special about it! It's in a great area with excellent schools and it comes with more ammenities than any other condo around here. Have you lived in a condo before?"
Yes I have and this definitely caught my attention. But again the price is really not what I am looking for.,This one is worth every penny its listed for and then some more..What price do you have in mind?
1297$,"I'm sorry but that's very, very, low for this area. It's actually offensive to low ball me like that"
Well then I guess I will not be able to afford this one and will pass it! Thank you though appreciate your time and effort!,"okay, best of luck in your search"
I would like to sell it for $40 because it is in good condition,I will take the $40!
I would like the chair for that price though is that possible.,Yes for the $40 I will give you the chair!
Would you take $135 for the chairs?,That is pretty close to what I was asking. They are in great shape. From a great retailer also. They are not junky. If you can pick them up and bring cash I would sell them for 135.
Is this a good neighborhood?,Yes. Very safe and child friendly. There is a neighborhood watch program as well.
any furniture included?,"Furniture, but not appliances. Kitchen table, chairs and couch, and recliner in living room."
can I give you 850 a month. 6 months in advance?,"I could do $900 a month, but that's without the furniture."
hi,"Hello, are you interested in this plasma tv?"
yes it's a very nice looking tv does everything work,"Yep, it's a steal at $50, no problems with the device."
"oh, wow i see it does'nt have hdmi ports that a major down for me however i can make the offer of$38","Well, if you look closely at the photo I uploaded, and ignore my reflection, I think you'll notice three board games in my house. I'll tell you what, I'll give you the TV, and 3 mystery boardgames, for $40, if you'll come pick it up tonight."
"well, i guess i can spare $40 and will to drop it off if you don't mind please",Okay.
Hello I am interested in buying your Tundra.,Sure. Do you have any questions?
"Yes, does it have any upgrades or customization's?","No, just all the features that came standard with the car when it was purchased. Satellite radio, Bluetooth, heated seats, etc."
"The asking price is quite high for stock features. I'm willing to offer 28,000 for the vehicle after a test drive.","There is no way I'm giving it to you for that cheap. This car goes for way more at a dealership than the price I listed, and it cost even more new. It is in great shape. I can deliver it, fix or change anything you need, whatever you need to accept it at it's price."
I could up the price to 33k and we could call it a deal.,33 actually works really well for me. Sure thing.
Hey is the Apartment still available?,"yes,are you willing to buy"
I'm interested but I have a few questions. What is the square footage and are the appliances new?,630-650 sq.ft
The price is too high for such a small apartment in that area. Can you go down at all?,but you are provided with all additional features
How well does the car handle?,It's a lot of fun on a curvy road...handles them like a dream..and I just added run-flat tires last month...so you're never going to be stuck
Well I am very interested...do you have copies of all the service records? Are you the only owner?,yes Ive been the only owner and I have had every planned maintenance done..cruising with the top down is heaven
what are some of the features,The bike has aluminum rims that are 20 inches. It also has a Schwinn frame. Great Bicycle!
sounds good i need a bike for my son can i offer you $30,I built the bike myself and cannot let it go for that much. Could you do 35? Otherwise Ill have to keep it and give it to my nephew for his birthday!
how about $35 that just 5 less than what your asking.,Ok fine!
Hi! I saw an ad for this mini cooper and I am very interested in buying it! Can you give me some more details?,"Sure thing! It's ""Ice Blue"" paint color, black leather seats, 16"" black alloy wheels, 6-star spokes and a Steptronic auto transmission. There's also a bluetooth and USB/Ipad adapter. I've done all regular maintenence, which I'll inclsude the paperwork for."
Awesome! Thanks for the information. I am willing to offer $6500 for the car. How does that price sound to you?,"That's pretty low. It's a great car. I was looking for $10,200 but I'm willing to take $8,500"
$7950 and you have a deal!,"Hmmm. Alright, deal!"
"hello, I am interested in buying your bicycle","Perfect, do you have any questions about it?"
Hello could you tell if me there is anything wrong with this item?,There are no faults with this system. It is in excellent condition and is unlike any other home theater.
When would I be able to pick it up if I bought it?,I could deliver it to you as soon as tomorrow if you would like.
That would be perfect. I'd be able to offer you $315 for it right now.,"315 is a little bit too low. Could I get you to agree to 350 for it? it is worth 450, but I am willing to take off 100."
"Hi, do you still have the car for sale?",Yes the car is still available.
Can we negotiate?,yes but we need to keep chatting a bit longer. What questions do you have about the product?
I would like to know what the dimensions of the drawer is,"Sure thing. The dimensions are as follows: 24 inch high, oval top 23 inch by 27 inch"
I meant the pull out drawer.,Those are the dimensions. How much are you willing to pay. I am selling it for a $100
"I can pay 60, and I'll come pick it up at your convience",60 is very very low. This is a really good table with a great quality.
"I know, but I'm willing to travel to you to pick it up and load in my car myself so that you don't have to lift a finger",Yeah but still I would need more. I can give you for $75 last price because its a reasonable price and very well worth the price
I can do 70,Okay then you still will have to come pick it up yourself
"Hi, I love vintage bikes!  Is it still for sale and can you tell me what has been replaced on the bike?","I love vintage bikes too! Yes, it is still for sale. The bike has a new set of wheels, new chain, and a new seat. It has also been rebuilt and relubricated. The rear wheel has a Shimano coaster brake hub. It is an awesome bike!"
It sounds like it is.  It's kind of hard to visualize without a picture so what is the least you will take for it?,I couldn't go lower than $100 because of all the work I've done on it and parts I've bought for it.
Understandable.  $100 is a good price.  I think I'll take it.,Great!
"Hey dude, how much for your stools? id love to buy em",I am flexible
I only have $45 in cash and dont get paid for a week so I cant get any more out of the bank until then and need the stools for a party tomorrow. Any chance you can do 45 homie?,seriously?
"yeah dude I really need the stools but cant make it to the bank in time, would be amazing if you could do 45, or something else we could work out? idk",retail is 79.99 so obviously I am not selling them for $45
It's only $20 off your list price though dude. Would you be able to do like $50 or $55 if I paid you the other 5 or 10 in a week? i really need these chairs man,"$20 off would be 59.99 not 45, and I can do $15 off and do $65 each, final offer"
i want to live in your house but i cant pay 1000k,It really is a nice home.
"i agree i lvoe the area , how old is the home",I am not positive. It looks nice I can't tell sorry.
will you do 500 ? i need to buy new beds and furtinure,I can't do half. I am sorry. It has a garage and a fenced in yard if you have kids.
i can do 600 if you waive the deposit,Honestly I think the lowest I can do is $800 with the deposit. I am sorry. That is what they go for in this neighborhood.
ok i can do 750 lowest and fits my bussdet,Ok I think we can make a deal.
"Hello, I am very interested in your item. Is the price negotiable?","Yes it is, but I do not want to sell it cheaply  it is in excellent shape and works perfect I hardly ever used it"
I have looked up the comps and it appears that you are basically asking full retail. Would you be willing to take $350?,"Well if you can come pick it up today, I will take 350 for it."
"Hello, is the house still available?","Yes, it is! You will love it!"
I have small kids is there grass in the backyard enough for them to play in?,There is lots of grassy areas there.
"Great!  You are asking a lot, tell me are the utilities included in this price?","Theres a nearby park, dishwasher, stove, refrigeral, central air and heating, etc."
Are the utilities included in the price?,They are not included. Its is PG&E
Since I will be responsible for the utilities would you consider coming down on your asking price?,"I would. I will come down to 3,300."
"I just transferred to the state and I have a lot of money tied up in moving expenses so my budget is tight would you consider 3,000?","I would, but just a little more. How about 3,150"
I guess I can squeeze another 150.  We won't be able to eat and the kids will have to go barefoot but at least we'll have a nice roof over our heads.,Theres always ramen noodles.
"You're very funny.  I'll accept 3,150",Deal! I'll add in a gift card to Giant supermarket. Done deal!
"8,500 is way higher than blue book value for a 1995. I am interested but at a more reasonable price.",I would be willing to go a little bit lower. How about 8000?
"I would offer you $5,500",That is too low of an offer for me to accept.
"Would you take $5,750",How about 6000 and a free car wash coupon?
"Hi, I am interested in becoming a Solis tenant.",Great
So what can you tell me about the price?,"Are you interested in a 1, 2, or 3 bedroom apartment?"
Just a one bedroom will be fine for me.,And are you interested in the in-home laundry?
"No, that won't be absolutely necessary if I can save some money.","Okay, we have a great deal going on right now. We'll pay your deposit and give you a $1000 credit toward your first month's rent. How does that sound?"
"That sounds great, but I am curious what the monthly rent would be?",Right now it's $1898.
"Okay, but that seems a little for me. I know there are a lot of nice finishes, but some of them-like laminate flooring-kind of make me worry that the apartment is a little cheap. I would looking to pay more around 1700.","Well, if you're willing to sign a 2-year lease rather than a 1-year, I can lower the price to $1775."
Is the dresser still available?,"yes it is, it is in good condition and a real steal at 550"
What size is this dresser?,it is about 5 feet long and maybe a foot and 1/2 deep
It is a little smaller than,it is a good size for a lot of different rooms or uses. Plus much easier to transport
Would you take $350?,"I could do 450, but that is about as low as I can go. I really hate to part with it."
$450 is too high for me. I can come up with $400 if you could deliver,425 and I'll deliver it
I'm interested in buying the GE Smart Home personal security alarm.,Great! How does $5 sound?
I think that's too high a price. I can get it elsewhere for $2.99,My guide light is brand new though. How about $4?
Will you throw in a money back guarantee?,Sure
It's a deal!,Great!
"Hi I am intersted in the Galaxy Note, would you take 130 for it?",I think that's too low. I can lower my price to $160
Hi I love the house but I can't afford $5395.,"Yes I know, but the price comes with everything that you get with it :)"
"I am a poor grad student, can you give me a break?  Please!",I can give it to you for $5000
"That's better, but still steep for me",That's the last I can do. I have others who are willing to pay more than what I have offered you.
Could you include utilities?,Yes we could work that out when we meet to finalize everything. How does tomorrow sound to you?
I will give you 50 for them,Hello!
Hey there,"I'm here!, hold on ..."
Okay,"Thanks,   There is no rust, and the cushions are recovered, no stains. How about 75?"
Perfect!,You going to pick them up?
"Hi, is it leather interior?",Yes it is and has heated seats as well
How much is left on the warranty?,"it is a 10 year 100,000 miles warranty so either 8 years or 58,000 miles"
Oh good. It's hard to tell from the photo. Is this a 2 door or 4 door?,It is a 4 door
"Any dings, dents, or scratches?",Not a mark on it.
"There is no fender, right?",Yes there is a fender.  I can see what you are talking about those are chrome air vents on the bottom that is exactally how it is suppose to look
Moon roof?,It sure does.  This car has every single available option that Toyota offers.
"Ok, I like the car, but I can't afford the 21,900. I was hoping you could let it go for $15329.","Sorry I can't do that I still owe 20,000 on the car that is the absolute lowest that i can go."
I was hoping we could negotiate.,"I can come down almost 2000 from what i was asking but there is no way that i could go down as low as you are thinking.  Are you able to get close to 20,000"
"I may be able to do $17,000","Well I am actually financing something bigger and can take a small hit I guess if I have to.  I could let you have it for 19,000.  Once you drive this car you will not regret it.  It is an amazing car I really wish I didn't need to sell it."
Im doing great.  How are you?  I am very interested in your amp is it still available?,"Oh great, yes it is do you have any concerns?"
how old is it?,I bought it less than 1 year ago but I think it's not much older than that.
Ok now I saw you are interested in possibly trading for a smartphone.  I have a Samsung Galaxy s5 with a broken screen.  Would you be interested in it?,"Yes that is something that I'm looking for, does it work other than the screen?"
as far as I know it does.  The screen is really bad so I can't be 100% sure but it will turn on and it was working great before it broke.  My 3 year old used it to kill a spider.,Can you get those screens repaired?
Yeah it does cost around $75 but the phone is worth around $200,"Oh cool, okay how much are you wanting to pay for the amp and the phone?"
well I was thinking with the phone I could add $25 cash.,"That seems like a good deal to me, thank you!"
Hi there! I saw the add for your bookcases and was wondering if you have any more information. Do they have any damage?,"HI, no they are in great shape and are stained to look vintage"
Okay. How much are you asking for them?,I would like to get 50 for them.
Would you be willing to do one for 20?,"I could sell one of them for that price, It's a set of two so I could go down to 40 for both."
"Hey there, I am Brian, I left an email about the apartment for rent.",Hello Brian thanks for writing. Do you have any questions about the apartment?
"I do, it's about the price. I like the location of this apartment very much, but the price is ridiculous. The post says there is a $500 off special. I'm curious, is that deducted from the price you listed the apartment at?",It would be on the price we both agree upon.
"So then with the $500 off, how does $700 sound all together?",There is no way that would be possible.
Then can we work out a deal close to that? I can assure you that I can pay rent on time.,The lowest I'm authorized to go is 900. And that would be the flat monthly rent. The first month's rent would be 400 with the deduction.
"If I give you 900, could we settle free parking for my first month as well?",Yes that can be done. So overall you'll be saving quite a lot. So 900 is good for you?
I am but I was looking for something closer to 400,400 is a bit too low. How about 600 dollars?  I will also deliver it to you.
"I'm interested in this bike, but I feel like it might be over my budget",can hav an offer? this bike is good as new
I am doing fine. Is this bike still available? I need it for my son who is going on a moutain bike trip. are you able to negotiate on the price?,"that perfect, yes I can slightly negotiate"
I am not sure how often we will use this bike afterwards so lets make it a cool hundred and it will be a deal.,"thats too low for me, but I could let it go for a cool 130 and you have to pick it up here, is that fair enough"
do i least get any gear with that? Lets do $115 I pick it up within the next hour.,ok let me settle for 120
Hi! I have been looking for one of these since they came out. Have you had it for long?,i just got is about a week ago

"hi, i am interested in this listing",Great! You will love it. It has amazing features and right by the mall.
are there any utilities included? price is a bit high for my budget,"Yes, it comes with utilities."
oh that is great. If i were to sign an 18 month lease instead of 12 months how much would my monthly rent go down?,"If you were to do that today, I can lower the price to 1100 w/ one month free."
okay awesome! I can do that!,Great. Enjoy and thank you
Hello,hi
Is this studio in a good area?,it i actually a lot of shops

How does 1350 sound? It is only a small amount less than what you are asking.,yes
Good working with you. I will come by tomorrow and take a look at it if it is okay.,ok
hi i am interested in a bike,Great! It's a terrific bike and I'm asking $200.
It is quite a bike but my budget is closer to 100. Don't get me wrong is nice but is not new.,"That's true, it's not new and does have some scuff marks. But it's in solid condition mechanically. How about $150?"
"Hello, I was wondering if the 3 BR family home was still available?",It sure is and we have had several people looking at it.
is the price flexible?,"Yes, I'm willing to work with you."
will you take $110 if i move it and pick it up myself?,$165 and it's yours. I'll have it ready to go.
Hello!,"hi, are you interested  in this vintage night stand?"
yes! very much so! I would love to redo it!,It would be a great project! do you have any questions?
"yes, is the price negotiable?",not by much. I could maybe take 12
I was think $10,if you can pick up within the hour i will take 10
I can definitley be there within the hour you are not to far from me.,great! see you soon!
"Yes, it is a nice place. Can you tell me more about it?","Sure thing. We're asking $1950 for the apartment, a studio, which is super conveniently located near the Cal campus and close to many dining options and outdoor activities"
Can I give you $1700? It is for a broke college student.,"We could do $1800, the apartment has been recently renovated and features new appliances"
Hello. I'm interested in the bike. How old is it?,"It's 4 years old, but it is in great shape. tires look practically brand new."
How good is the TREK brand? I never heard of it,"Trek is very well respected in the biking community. This is a great bike to commute to work with, or to get into road-biking"
Great. Would you accept $157 for the bike?,"I think that's a bit low for a bike in this condition, I could go as low as $200, but I could deliver it too you"
I can't do $200. Would you accept $180 and I pick it up from you?,That sounds like a fair deal. Thanks!
Hi does this case come with a glass protection,"Yes, it has a built in screen protector. Just $5"
Will my phone break at all with this? And can you do $3,"No, your phone will be safe with this. I think $4.25 is more than fair."
I mean they don't make iPhone 5 anymore and I really like this particular phone and don't want it to break,"I can understand that. It's a very hard case, very durable. It's also shock-absorbent in case you drop it. This thing will definitely protect your phone, very little risk of breaking. $4.25"
Will it protect in water?,"Yes, it has a water resistant mesh that will even protect the speakers. It also has button  & port covers on the case. Want it?"
Yes I do want it but I honestly only have $3 and I think I'm doing you a favor by getting this off your hands,"It is an older case, but there are still a lot of iPhone 5's out there. This case is in new condition as well. $3.00 is just too low. what about $4?"
Amazon actually has this same case for a $1 i was just instrested in your case because of the color,It is a lovely shade of blue. The lowest I can possibly go is $4. That's less than a sandwich around these parts.
Hi there. I saw your ad of the wood glass book case. It really got my attention. I loved the interior of it. Is it new or used?,its used so that is why im selling it for a really good deal of 95
Yeah but the amount is too much for me. I can afford to pay 72 for it. That's what I got since its used I would really appreciate if we could work that out,this is an antique so although it is used it is very good bookcase
Okay how about $75?,90
That's too much for me I honestly can't afford that,i can bring it to you
Okay how about 85$ I loved this piece and I would really like to get it!,ok 85 is finr
"Yes, I am. Based on the comps in the area I would be willing to pay 1,300.",thats a bit low for this how about 1500
"1,500 is just outside my budget. Could we do 1,425?",ok i can go for $1425 download the app in the link
"Great, thank you!",thanks
What all does the phone already have on it?,The phone is completely erased with no leftover data from the previous user.
I was hoping for music or something. Do you have the manual>,"There is a manual and there is iTunes leftover credit for $12, so you can buy some music with that."
Is the screen like new?,"Yes! No scratches. It currently has a screen protector on it, which you can chose to keep on or take off."
I could offer $230.00,I would sell for $300.
$250?,$280 with headphones.
I could do $255 with the headphones.,I would do $265 without the headphones or $280 with headphones.
I'll meet you half way at $260 with the headphones.,Sure.
i would love to buy,Sure! What's your price?
im on a budget so i could do 1850,How about $1900 and I'll wave the deposit.
i will take it,Great!
"Yes, I am. It looks nice on the outside but how many miles does it have?",It has 75k miles. All maintenance has been done and I have paperwork.
"I was hoping for less miles. But since it has that many, how would you feel about letting me get it for $6000?",That price is too low for me. I would be willing to part with it for $9000.
That's still a bit much. Does it still have any warranties left on it?,"Yes, it still has 1 year left on the 7 year warranty. I can maybe go as low $8750."
"Hi, I'm interested in the bike you have for sale.",Its a Felt Q Series 220 model with great accessory items and road tires.  It is in nice original condition.  The price is $250 and I can deliver it or you can pick it up
"I'm looking at a couple others that are less expensive, but I like the color of yours. Will you go lower if I pick it up?",The bikes sell and are high end for about $500.  I would even go to $215 if you pick it up
I am interested in the rental but I think the price is high. Can you bring it down to 3450? I would love to make this deal work.,This is an excellent property with a lot of demand. I can't drop the price that much. I can however offer to maintain the furniture that is currently in the property. This should help save on furnishing costs.
I am interested in renting with the furniture. Thank you. I am also ready with first last and deposit. Are you able to drop the price slightly? How about 3850?,I can offer $3900.
It is a beautiful property. Lets make the deal for 3900 and include the furniture,We have a deal.
Is 45 a good price for you?  I will pick it up myself.,"yeah, I think 45 is fair. That works for me."
Hiya ill offer you $2500 for the bungalow. Fair enough?,That price is too low for this fantastic 2 bedroom home. We can negotiate a fair price if you can be reasonable.
sure whats a fair price?,We can lower it to 2800 if you have good employment history.
How many miles are on the car?,"Hello, as of right now its around 165k"
I'm interested but that's a quite a bit of miles and 5900 seems a little high how close would you go to 5000?,the lowest i would go is 5200.
5200 sounds great as long as everything is working and I can have a mechanic check it out first.,That sounds good to me.
Hello. Yes I am! Can you tell me the condition?,It's in wonderful condition!  It's been customized to be one of the most badassness bikes you will ever ride!!  Everyone will be looking and wishing they had it when you ride it!
Thats,I'm asking $340 for it.
"Sorry about that. Technical difficulties! The bike is just what I'm looking for, but would you take $225?",I could do $300 cash.
"Ok, I can swing that. I don't want to pass up the badassness!",Ok you got a deal!
"Hey, that's a sweet case.","Thanks. It's brand new, unopened. Are you ready to purchase?"
Yeah.  I'll give you $6 for it.,I can't go as low as $6. Can you do $8?
Yes I am but the price is a bit high. Any wiggle room in the price?,"Well, it's a beautiful apartment and very convenient. However, I am willing to listen to your offer and see if we can come to an agreement."
Would you offer the unit for $2000?,"Best I can do is come down to 2500 even. I have expenses I have to cover, and I've put a lot of work into it before putting it on the market."
"That seems reasonable. How about $2400? I would really like to rent this unit. However, I do wish it came with a private parking spot instead of off-street parking, but I am still very interested if you can come down to $2400.","I think I can live with that. I accept your offer of $2,400. Let's set up a meeting to get the ball rolling."
"Hello! I'm interested in this product, but I'd like to know if you're willing to negotiate a few things first.",What would you like to negotiate?

yes you did but I mentioned I have cash that I'm ready to spend with you or someone else.  I like the car but the best I can do is 13550,"Ok tell you what you will get 4 wheel locks for each rim, a coupon for a free oil change at chevy and Ill deliver it personally on a trailer so you will recieve it at the exact advertised miles."
"ok, I'm getting a headache now.  The options are good so I'll pay 13790",delightful thank you very much for your business
You're welcome.  Looks great.  I'd love to come see it.  What are the schools like?,The schools in the area are great and it's in a really nice neighborhood.\

I can pay 2400 in cash right now,"If you can do 3100 ill submit the final offer right now, and drive it over to you. do we have a deal?"
"Make it 3000, pay for a mechanic to inspect it and drive it over and we can make the deal.","done, i'm submitting the price now"
Hello. This is an interesting listing. That is a lot of chairs to go with one table.,"it is a very large wood table, and I know very many chairs! It is a great looking table though."
"I do not really have room for so many chairs, although I will want some to go with the table. Would you consider taking the price down and removing the two armchairs from the offer?","I am selling for $3000, but if you do not need the armchairs, then I would consider going down to $2400"
The listing states that you will help with the move. Do you have a means to transport the table and remaining chairs?,I have a large truck I hae rented for my move that  Ican swing them by in.
I do! No pics though. Could you do $15? I'm broke and trying to pay off my student loans. #thestruggleisreal,"I took pics but I couldn't figure out how to upload them. I'm technologically challenged. they are new and still in the box, I got the wrong color and the store won't take it back so I'm selling it for $26."
"Yeah, well I'm financially challenged. $18 is all I've got. Cash today, I can come pick it up! And bake you some cookies.",Lol. Sure. You've got yourself a deal

That's good. Do you ask for a deposit?,"Yes, we do require a deposit, but the amount depends on your credit. The townhouse is going for $1815."

"yes I am , does it have any dents ?","No, it is in great shape."

Hello,Hello. This has just been reduced down to $700
Great! Is it in good condition?,It is in great condition. It is hardly used.
I think 700 dollars might be a little too steep of a price for this couch. Could you possibly lower the price down to 500?,Would you be able to take it right away?
"Yes, I can come pick it up today if it is possible.",Then you can have this for 500.
Great. So do we have a deal?,Yes
"Its got a salvaged title, that price is way too high for a salvaged title. the only way id go that high is if you would throw in an more premium steering wheel and tires","Salvage is perfectly acceptable, but I can throw in some premium tires, if you'd like"
"I would love that, would you willing to do 15500 for the wheels and the car? I would definitely do the deal then cash in hand","16000, while wheels, title, and car delivered to you"

"I see that's wonderful!  I was hoping to pay closer to 240 because I am very broke, are you willing to meet me there or have anything to add to the value?",I'd accept $260 and throw in a charger and case.
"I am, How firm are you on the price of $15,000. would you be willing to go lower if I came soon with cash?","Yes, If you come today or tomorrow with cash, I can lower the price to $12,000."
Would you be willing to go $7500 and ill leave now? Your ad states you simply found it in a barn.,"I did, but it was an incredible find. It is in excellent condition. The lowest I can go is $10,500."
Is it in good shape?,"Not only is it in excellent shape, but Dua Lipa engaged in intimate relations with a random groupie on it just yesterday! That has nothing to do with why I'm selling it, though."
That seems a little high. Can you come down some?,"I sure can, but you'll need to pick it up.  How does $288.69 sound?"
"Well, I don't mind picking it up, but I was thinking more like $200.",I'm not sure I can go that low. How does $260 sound? I'll even throw in pictures of Stanford alumni!
I don't really need the picture. Do you have chairs that match?,"Actually, I do, though there are a couple stains on them.  I can throw them in, at the $260 price point. How's that sound?"
How about 210 without the chairs?,"That's tempting; this is 123 inches of polished wood, and very hard and strong.  Will you meet me at $240?"

"I see that it is only 3G, whereas most of the newer smartphones are now 4G.  Given that, would you accept $7 for the smartphone?","Yes, that sounds fair to me"
it's an oem set? was it made by blackberry or a third party?,"This is the real mccoy my friend, an oem headset."
well these days they call a third party made products oems now. you can never be sure. anyway how about i give you 5 bucks for it?,"Oh, I'd don't think that will work. This is a fine piece of equipment, it even comes with an On/Off button, as I listed in my description."
"well, they all have on and off buttons now. it's not a big deal. besides we';ve had on and off buttons on things for a century. tell you what, 6 bucks. i come and pick it up. you don't even have to leave your house.",Let this incredible headset go at only $6? I couldn't take less than 8.50!

Ok...any scratches or dents?,it has a few chips around the edges and some marks on top. the front view is great. it has a very nice vintage patina!

I can pick it up now for $400 cash,make it $450 and we have a deal
"hi, i am very interested in your car","Great! It's in really shape, very dependable car."
are there any issues?,"No major issues at all, the only this is a small rip on the driver's side seat, but it's hardly noticeable."
would you take 3150 if i picked it up tonight?,"I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping for just a bit more. Do you think you could come up to $3300?"
"If you can throw in seat covers, I can do 3300",I can totally throw in the seat covers. You've got a deal!
How old is the bike?,I'm not sure. It has new tires and made in the USA

It sounds nice. How many bedrooms is the available unit?,It's a 2 bedroom
"That's good enough, but for a 2 bedroom I would expect to pay more like 900. Could you negotiate on the rent?",900 would be crazy low for a 2 bedroom in the bay area. I don't think any exist anymore. I could offer you a one bedroom? We have one coming open at the end of the month for 1620
"Wow, this looks great!",It is in excellent condition.
Great! New?,"I apologize, this piece of furniture has had nail polish remover spilled on the top of it. So it actually needs refinished."
Not a problem. It will just effect how much I pay a little. How much are you asking?,I'm asking $650 for it as it is an antique.
How about 575? I'll pick it up and pay it in fill.,That's fine! I will accept your offer. I only take cash.
"hi, how big is the bookshelf",It's about 4.5 feet wide by 2.5 feet deep.

"great, i'll come pick it up tonight!",Done
Hello. How much use does the bike have,I haven't used it much at all. I have been very busy which is why I'm selling it.
Okay. How much do you want for it?,I am thinking about $1800. It is a very good quality bike.
"That is a bit out of my price range. Seeing as it's been repainted and it is a few years old, would you accept 1200?",Would you consider maybe 1300?
"Good Morning, I was interested in purchasing your Iphone 4 you have listed",Great. This is a great phone and it is in excellent condition.
Do you have any wiggle room on the price of $85? Perhaps I could come pick it up today with cash.,I can offer you $75 and throw in two free cases.
"It is a rather old device, Would you go $60? Its pretty outdated with only 3G, I just need something temporary to get me by.",Will you be able to pick it up by 7 tonight?
"Hi, yes I am, are you a store or is this private party?","I work at a store. I got it as a bonus, but I don't need another phone, so I'm selling it."
"Ahh ok I see. Before I buy it, can you send me the ESID on the phone? You don't have to give it to me now, but before I hand over the money I want to run a check to make sure it's not blacklisted or reported stolen or anything.",I can do that for you.
"Alright, great. Now, I know you're wanting $850 for it, but really I'd like to pay around $500, is there anything you can do for me?",Lowest I can go is $650 with a trade-in.
"Trade-in, $650, and you throw in those wireless headphones?","The wireless headphones don't come with the phone, so I'm afraid not."

does the phone have a warranty,"It comes with a 1 year warranty, yes."
i can offer you $80,I can't go that low unless you have a trade in. this is a 400 dollar phone. We could meet somewhere in the middle like 200?
if the phone is flawless i can give you an extra $100 that makes it$180,Yeah it's flawless. If you trade in your old phone with it I will do 180
i can do that when can i pick it up.,As soon as possible. You got yourself a deal!
Hi do you still have the iPhone for sale?,"Yes I do, are you interested?"
Yes. What kind of condition is it in?,Almost new. I've always had a case and tempered glass screen protector on it. So no scratches and no nicks.
Can you be flexible on the price? I see these on eBay for much less,"Those may be fakes on ebay. If you read the ad, I've already set the price well below other sellers. But if you want I can throw in the case and 2 spare screen protectors."
I'll give you $250 for it.,$250 is way too low. I can maybe go down to $350.
I am. Is there any damage to the fabric or anything?,No damage at all! They are in perfect condition. My wife and I are fixing to mixing to China so we are trying to get rid of some patio furniture before the move.
Sounds like you need them to go then! 1500 is quite steep though for 2 chairs. I could do 750 and come pick them up myself today and have them out of your hair.,Oh we do! And yea it was my wife's idea to start the price that high. I'd be willing to deliver them to your home and even unload the truck for $900

Hello to you.  That is a very nice Ikea Wardrobe.  Has it been heavily used?,"No, it is nearly brand new. We only used it for about two months"
Excellent.  I am willing to offer $280 for the wardrobe and will arrange for pickup.,"Well I have it listed for $450, $280 is kind of a lot lower than I planned to go."
"I understand.  We have three children under the age of 4, and money is kind of tight.  But I am interested in this wardrobe.  What about $300?","Awe, I have two that young as well. I can do $300!"
"Hi, I'm great thanks for asking.  I'm very interested in the phone, and I'll even come and pick it up myself, but I don't think I'll take the screen protector or SIM card.  Can we settle on 140?",Yeah that sounds great to me!
I'm interested in buying this chair! What shape is it in?,"hi, office chair, it's in ok condition, needs a bit of work... so i have $10 as my price... i bet you can't a chair cheaper than that :D"

Hello,Hi how are you?
Good. I am in the market for a new bike. Is this one in good shape?,"This one is in fantastic shape! It's got some great options too. It has a step thu frame, cantilever brakes and a shimano drivetrain."
That sounds awesome. How much do you want for it?,"I'm asking $350 for it, but I'm willing to negotiate, especially for cash."
Would you be willing to lower the price down to 250? I will pick it up myself.,"Sorry, 250 is too low. I'll deliver it myself for $300, and we have a deal."
Hi so does the subwoofer work?,"Yes, it's brand new, and just out of the box."
Ok are all the cords included?,"Absolutely; this usually retails for 100, but my friend gave it to me when she moved, and hadn't ever used it."
"Sounds good, so the lowest you'll take is $50?","Yes, I'll go down to $50. That's a heck of a deal."
I agree! Thank you so much. This is going to sound awesome in my car.,Splendid! :)
Where the rest of the floorplan? it must be at least two stories. i only see 2 bedrooms and 1 bath on the floor shown,yes exactly. this is a 3 bedroom 1.5 bathroom townhouse. There is a master bedroom upstairs.
I see. Well it's the right size I need. What do you say we agree on 1 year lease at 2500 a month?,This house is at a very convenient location and I'm afraid your offer is below its market value now. If you have your income proof I can do $2600.
"That's a bit too high. Tell you what. I'll do 2 year lease at 2500,. you don't have to worry about finding a new tenant in a year, I don't have to worry about moving in a year. we both win",That sounds good. Please have all you documents ready and I will prepare the lease for your to sign.
"Yes, but I was wondering when it last had maintenance and the age of the bike overall.",I brought it to the bike shop around 4 months ago to get some maintenance done and I bought the bike brand new about a year ago
"That's pretty new, sounds like the brakes need some maintenance though. Do you ride it often?","Yeah they do, but I'm fairly certain a good cleaning and some lube will take care of the squeeking. I rode it a lot in college."
"Ah, that makes sense for the amount of wear then. Would you be willing to take $100 for it if I load and pick up myself? That way I have a little money for the brakes.",Yeah $100 is fine but make sure you pick it up today because I really need the cash rite now.
Hey there this place looks sweet! What can you tell me about it?,hello. this is a 1 bed 1 bath apt. its spacious and has a great den. walk in closet in the master bedroom. large living room and all major appliances included. there is also a private patio i'm asking 2608
"Wow sounds very fancy. Could you guys do $2300 for it since I have to pay movers and everything which will raise the total cost to well over $2608, I'm just trying to save a little bit on this expensive move.","2300 is a little low. this place is near shops and parks. how about 2500, and i'll waive the 300 deposit"
"Hello, how much would you like for the apartment?","Hello, thank you for your interest, the apartment is $2250 a month"
"Yes, $2250 a month sounds fair. I will submit that as a final agreement.",Excellent thank you
"Hello, I saw your advertisement for a lamp and I would like to offer you $40 for it.",Hello.  Glad you are interested in the lamp. It is a great piece and vintage.  I could accept $75.
"Well, it's listed at $70 and I'm interested in the design, but I would have to do a conversion to the regular bulb.","Yes, I will accept $70 for the piece.  You will be pleased with the look and the great condition."
"I think that's an acceptable price, but as I mentioned I'll have to do the conversion.  The best I could offer is $50.",How about I meet you at $55?
"Sure, I think that's reasonable.  Thanks.",Great!
I certainly am. They are exactly what I have been looking for.,That's great! Do you have any questions about them?
Are the seat covers removable?,"yes they are! You can throw them in the washing machine and bam, back to new!"
Hi I saw your bike online and i'm very interested,Hello
Yes what shape are the tires in?  Also how is the paint on the body,"It is in great condition, nice and clean. The paint and tires are perfect. It is only 6months old"
"Ok sounds good, just what I was looking for.  I can bring you $700 cash right now.","Well as the ad says, the price is pretty firm at $1350 ..."
Yeah I saw that but it is a used bike and I don't know who had it before you and how good they took care of it.  Also you could have the cash in your hand today and I would be glad to come pick it up and load it myself,"Like I said, it is only 6 months old. The suspension alone is worth the asking price."
"Well people may be hesitant to buy with you selling it so soon, they might wonder why you want to get rid of it?  I can do $1000 cash and I'll pick up!",Ok I can do $1000 cash if you come by tonight.
Good thanks! I'd love to but this place. What can you tell me about it?,"Its a great location. Its in a quiet setting, security tied, has a very huge kitchen, lots of cabinet space, and tiled floors. Its very spacious."
"Wow, sounds like just what I need! Could we do it all for $2600? That would be the perfect price for me!",Great we can do that! You will however have to pay me a deposit before reserving it for yourself?
"Hello, I am interested in the mattress. Is it still available?",It sure is.  $120 and it is all yours
I was hoping that if I come pick it up today I could get it for 100,Ill tell you what how about we meet in the middle and you can have it for 110
Can we do 108?,sure
Hi I am interested in in the Lewis Apartment Communities,Its a good choice. Our price is $1556
"I am loving all of the features it has to offer. I can definitely see myself, my family, and including my dog, living here.",Its a great place for families
I know you have a list price for it but would you be willing to accept a lower price? I was looking to pay a lower price for it. Thanks,yes the price is negotiable.
"I was looking to pay around $1,089","Keeping in mind that these are very desirable and selling fast, i am sorry but your iffer is too low"
what is the lowest that you are willing to go?,i think 1400 is a steal
okay that's a deal. I'm ready to move my family and I into this beautiful community,i think you will be very happy here.  Thank you and welcome.
Hi is your item still for sale?,yes I still have it for sale are you interested?
"Very much, I think it is the perfect fit. The price is just a little bit too high for me.",Well I think the price is pretty fair because it's still very new and did not get much use at all so it's in perfect condition and it's priced much lower than new ones.
Could you maybe lower it to $540?,Well how about 550 and I throw in the extra bracket?
Does the car still have a warranty on it?,Sorry the warranty has already expired. It is still a very good SUV though no problems at all and no cosmetic defects.
I'm tight on funds but I own a landscaping company. Would you be willing to take $4900 and 6 months lawn care?,5000 and 6 months lawn care and you have yourself a deal!
"That's a great TV, but I'm on a really strict budget.  I busted our TV when I was doing a roundhouse kick in the living room showing off for friends.  I'm in the doghouse big time, but can only afford $700.","Sorry to hear that. Well you are definitely in luck. Your offer is too low though, remember this is a brand new Smart TV. The specs are great. I am willing to do $1100"
It does sound like a great deal.  How about $1000 cash?  I can pick it up within the hour and will be grateful till the end of time!,$1050 and you have a deal.
"Hi, I'm interested in the apartment.",Awesome is there anything specific you would like to know about it
Are any utilities included in the rent?,Yes all utilities are included
"The apartment sounds nice, but I really need a place with a washer/dryer and a dishwasher. I work a lot and don't have time to get everything done on my own.","We have  a laundry facility on site for your convenience, and if you would like i can have a dishwasher installed for you."
"I think if we can get a dishwasher in there, I would be comfortable paying $1150 in rent.",i think we can work with that.
Hello I am quite interested in this excercise cycle,Awesome do you have any questions before I make an offer?
Yes may I ask why you are selling it are there any issues with it?,There are no issues with the product I have no use for the product as I recently had my legs bitten off by a shark!
I see I'm very sorry to hear damn those sharks and their actually really low human attack rate. Ok all things considered with the cycle being fully assembled and since I have to pick it up which will be a bit more difficult would you mind lowering to $95,I will do it! I am feeling very generous as I have a new perspective on life after the accident!
"Yes, I'm not sure is this the latest model.",Just checking. I've got a few other items for sale. It's not the latest but I kept it in pristine condition.
"Since it is not new, I would like to offer you half of the list price.",New sim card. Original everything. Always had a screen protector. I'm asking $160 which is a pretty good discount from what you'd pay at the Apple store.
I think $100.00 is more reasonable since it is like new condition. It is a phone and there are no other perks available.,"They're selling for $210 on Amazon without the Sim Card. I'll take $150 to get a deal done now, but otherwise I'm not in a hurry to sell. What do you think?"
This Apple iPhone is not new. There is no case offered and I need a warranty or assurance that it will continue to work. My offer is $120.00. I think this is a very reasonable deal.,I think we're just too far apart on what we're looking for. Hopefully you find the deal you're looking for somewhere else! Have a good day.
"Hello, do you unlocked phones work with all networks?",yes they do work
Awesome and do you have different colors? I'm looking for the Moto in rose gold.,Yes I do have a selection of colors. You can text me your number and I could send you all the available colors.
"Well, my phone is broken which is why I need a new one. I'd like one of yours but the price is a little high. How would you feel about accepting $120","Well I can accept that, but you probably will have to get it shipped yourself. I can't pay for the shipping then or you can come pick it up from me and choose the colors right there!"
I'd rather have you ship it. I go to $130 if you ship it and through in a bluetooth headset.,Cool that's a deal then!
"Hi, I'm interested in purchasing the bike.  What is the asking price?",100.00\
Hello,This is a great chest. An amazing chest.
It looks great. How much are you looking to get for it?,I'm starting at $75.
Are you willing to go any lower for it? I would like to spend 67 dollars at the most for it.,"You're only asking for $8 less, and I can assure you you're paying for a quality chest."
Is it in great condition? I want something that is very durable.,"It's very solid, and it'll make you very solid. It's a great chest."
Okay. I will offer 70 dollars for it. Is that okay with you?,"You got a deal, boy-o."
Hi I am recovering from credit card debt and cannot pay your asking price of 13000 will you be able to work with me?,Hello how are you today? I have a great deal for you. Okay what did you have in mind as far as price?
Well I have saved up some money and can also include a very nice leather briefcase and could pay 10000 in cash today if you are wanting to finish the deal?,"Well, I know what it is to be in debt which is the reason why I have to sell my prized truck. Okay what do you say we do $11000 and I will throw in a free oil change for you."
"Oh yea, that's sounding pretty good to me, let's do it!",You've got a deal!
Hi I saw that you have a Long term care bed for sale.,"Yes it is in excellent condition. It can be raised and lowered by remote, asking $2100."
It would be for my wife. She weighs 375 pounds. Will it be able to hold her weight?,Yes on page 3 of the manual it shows it can carry 396lbs
Great! The doctor told me she might gain 21 more pounds. Unfortunately our food budget has been skyrocketing putting me in a bind. Is there any way you can sell it for $750?,"No that is far too low, this bed is barely used, state of the art, includes bed rails and mattress so I cannot go lower than 2000."
She is only expected to live another 6 weeks before her illness takes her. Ive already started digging her grave in the back yard. I can go up to $1000 plus I will give it back once she croaks.,I am sorry for the difficult time you are going through but the lowest I can do is 2000.
$1001?,"No sorry that is far too low. You can buy it for 2000, and resell it when you no longer need it"
Alright. This is my final offer. $1500 plus you finish digging the hole for her. AND you cook for her for the next 6 weeks. Take it or leave it.,No thank you
Yes do your item have in marks or scatches?,"Not really, it is in very good condition. I would really like to get it off my hands quick, so how does 50 dollars sound?"
The list price is $40 I would be willing to do $35-40,"Alright, I can do 40."
Hey there! I love the look of this bike! Is it sturdy and reliable? In good condition and everything?,Excellent condition and not more than a couple hundred miles on it.
"Awesome! Well if its in such well condition and really well maintained, would you be willing to let go of it for $1300? I can stop by today and pick it up from your place with cash if you want.",It's an F1 carbon bike with Shimano parts...it's a Rock-n-Roll bike. I'll go down to $1500. Final Offer.

"Hello, yes I am interested. I am willing to pay $35 for the service please.","I will accept $35, just for you!"
You there/,Yes it is. It's in a nice area and has a lot of extras and add-ons. It is a great value for you money. Look at the list and let me know if you have any questions
Are there shopping areas around?,"Yes, near a busy part of San Francisco. So much to do"
That's good. Would you need a deposit as well?,It would depend on how much you're willing to pay rent wise. I could get rid of the deposit if you agree to pay the listed price.
I can afford 2622?,I don't know can you?
I am asking you would you be willing to accept $2622?,That's a little random. We can do 2700 and it's a deal
okay that works for me then! Thanks,Thanks.
I'm interested in the Iphone case you posted for sale.,Yes sure. Do you have any questions?
I don't think I have questions.  Are you willing to part with it for $5?  I can pick it up today.,Yes I think I can do that because I honestly am just getting rid of it and not using it for myself. Its been sitting in my storage for months now. Anything I will take for it! So sure!
"Hello, would you accept $3,000 in cash?",Are you willing to pick it up?
I can pick it up this evening.,Ok great
"Hi, I just saw you 530i listing. How much are you looking for for it?","I am looking to get $4000 for it.  It is in great shape for the yr.  Runs great.  Been well maintained on everything.  Has only 136,000 miles on it and the SMOG was done just a few days ago.  Literally ready to go@  I will also throw in an extra set of rims with it!"
Yes I am interested in the desk but would you have any way of delivering/transporting it?,Yeah I have a truck if you pay for the gas
"Okay I could do that, would you be willing to come down on the price a little if I cover the gas?",What did you have in mind?
Could you come down to $55,Plus $10 for gas i can do $60 on the price.
That's reasonable I can do the $60 for the desk plus $10 for gas/transport,great
"Hello, I am interested in your house. Looking at comps I would be willing to pay 1,250","Hi. Well, we're not too far apart. I can let this for 1,400. Ok?"
"If we could do $1,350 I would take it.","Hmmm. It's a very nice place, I'm pretty sure I can get 1,500, but ok, let's call it 1,375 and we'll have a deal."
"Okay, that would be acceptable to me.",Great!
This mirror is stunning! Is it in good condition?,Yes. I just never found a place for it. Would you like to buy it?
I am very interested but can't quite see myself spending $200 on it. Would you be willing to drop the price to $175?,"For that price, would you be willing to pick it up?"
I absolutely will pick it up!,Then you have a deal.
I might be if we can negotiate an acceptable price.,"Ok, it's our last one, and a steal at $1875.  If offers internet access, and is in a prime location, close to Interstate 580."
"Hello, I saw your ad for your iphone 7, so it is brand new sealed in box?","Yes, Its completely brand new. Never used."
Will it work with Boost Mobile?,It's unlocked and will work with every service provider.
"Excellent, I think my only concern is the lack of a warranty.  Do you provide any protection?  What if it breaks within the first week or month of using it?","Good question. It does not have a warranty, but I believe that apple-care is around $99. I could knock off a bit of the selling price so that you could purchase the apple-care. I'm looking to get this off my hands ASAP."
"Okay, I'm comparing it to several other offers I've seen on ebay.  What about if we do $550 so that I can get that applecare warranty and I'll bring you cash today?","That's a bit low for me. This model sells for around $1,000 if you were to purchase a new one today and the condition of this phone is completely new and untouched. What if I offered $620?"
"I'm still a little nervous that it won't work with my network, if it doesn't work with Boost will you take it back within 24 hours?",I understand. I would definitely take it back as long as it's within a 24 hour period. You could check with your provider and get back to me. You could also do that while we're together before you even hand me the money.
"Okay good idea, then let's meet and I'll bring the $620 and call Boost while we're together, sound good?",You have a deal.
Hi is this still available?,hi yes it is i am selling it for 39
Does it have the internet?,yes it does
Does it come with a sim card?,yes everything is intact..would you still like to purchase?
"Yes. But since it is from the 90's, the most I can pay is $23.",its from 2017 and i am selling you it for a great deal thats like new
